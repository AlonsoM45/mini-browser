And The Call delivered. The emotion is there, and it's pretty raw at times, but it's emoted in unexpected ways. The characters cracked me up, felt very real, and the story was believable and at times serious, then light, then laugh-out-loud funny. I really enjoyed the writing style, and although it did take a few pages of adjustment, I was very glad I stuck with it. In the same way that Cormac MacCarthy's writing is at first difficult to take in, this was a little bit tough to &#34;get&#34; until I'd gotten through several pages.

I am really impressed, both by the low price and by the overall quality and value of the set.  The real usefulness of a set like this is in the way it can facilitate the speed and accuracy of character recognition.  I'm looking forward to using it this way.  The cards are plastic coated, so they won't get \"funky\" like the ones I made for myself some time ago.  Each card has a series of words written in kana, which aids in the reading of whole words.  One of the most important features involves a high quality CD that comes with the cards.  Using the CD in conjunction with the cards allows the learner to completely avoid using roomaji, and go directly from the Japanese character to the correct Japanese pronunciation.  The 200 cards include the so-called \"twisted sounds\" as well as the \"voiced\" sounds.  There are also wall charts of the characters, which, sad to say, I still find necessary on occasion.  For the beginner, such charts would be of great value.  I am currently teaching \"Scientific Communication in English\" at the Tokorozawa Campus of Waseda University.  I am a colleague of Konomi-sensei at Portland State University and have also been a student in a Japanese class in which she was the instructor.  She is truly a master teacher, and has used her considerable skills to produce a valuable and useful aid in the flash card set.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Hiragana and Katakana Flashcards - WOW -", "unixReviewTime": 1353974400, "reviewTime": "11 27, 2012"}

After getting them delivered and seeing how small and lightweight they are, I was skeptical.  After hooking them up, I was surprised by how good the sound quality was.  They are very easy to install.  I used a 3.5mm Stereo Female to RCA Male Y-Cable to attach the transmitter to an audio out plug on my AV Reciever.  This way I can play CDs or listen to the music channels from Cable TV.  I have them plugged into wall sockets, instead of using batteries, since other reviews said the sound quality isn't as good with the batteries (although I never did try batteries).  I bought a second pair of speakers (comes with a free transmitter) to use on another section of the patio, still using just the one transmitter.

Got to thinking it would be neat if I could convert an entire DVD movie to a SINGLE Mpeg file. Found a program that does that. Ok, NOW I have an entire movie on a little stick and in the process all the dvd files were compressed a lot with no noticable loss in video or audio quality! Trouble was NOW I'd like to view this on my tv. Did some looking and found this thing.My only complaints are that the usb and flash card ports are upside down and it should have come with an HDMI cord.
