The characters cracked me up, felt very real, and the story was believable and at times serious, then light, then laugh-out-loud funny. I really enjoyed the writing style, and although it did take a few pages of adjustment, I was very glad I stuck with it.

I am really impressed, both by the low price and by the overall quality and value of the set.  The real usefulness of a set like this is in the way it can facilitate the speed and accuracy of character recognition.  I'm looking forward to using it this way.  The cards are plastic coated, so they won't get \"funky\" like the ones I made for myself some time ago.  Each card has a series of words written in kana, which aids in the reading of whole words.  One of the most important features involves a high quality CD that comes with the cards.  Using the CD in conjunction with the cards allows the learner to completely avoid using roomaji, and go directly from the Japanese character to the correct Japanese pronunciation.  The 200 cards include the so-called \"twisted sounds\" as well as the \"voiced\" sounds.  There are also wall charts of the characters, which, sad to say, I still find necessary on occasion.  For the beginner, such charts would be of great value.  I am currently teaching \"Scientific Communication in English\" at the Tokorozawa Campus of Waseda University.  I am a colleague of Konomi-sensei at Portland State University and have also been a student in a Japanese class in which she was the instructor.  She is truly a master teacher, and has used her considerable skills to produce a valuable and useful aid in the flash card set.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Hiragana and Katakana Flashcards - WOW -", "unixReviewTime": 1353974400, "reviewTime": "11 27, 2012"},

It's a very accessible devotional, and not something you have to work at to read.That doesn't mean I consider it fluffy or frothy -- far from it. Rose Chandler Johnson covers a wide range of topics and bases each devotional entry on a Scripture passage. The passages she chooses are from all over the Old and New Testaments; they are mostly well-known verses, but she manages to bring a fresh perspective to them. She is able to be profound without becoming pedantic or obtuse -- and that is a hard balance to maintain.This would be a great devotional for a new Christian, but even the more seasoned believer will get a lot out of it, despite the fact that it is intentionally light reading.

It isn't bad, but it certainly isn't great.I quickly ran out of room as I upgraded my kit.The compartment system is a bit odd. It consists of velcro and padded fabric. It holds things in place fairly well, but it rarely maintains the shape I want, so I sort of have to re-arrange it each time I put lenses back.Way too expensive for what I got.Overall, I thought the bag was very too expensive for what I got.

If the coil worked i would give this 5 stars.The arrangement i have is i have used L brackets to hang this from the wall over my window. The whole idea was to use the screen when needed and else roll it up to let light come through the window. now since its half way rolled down; i cant seem to utilize my window.

They are fast moving and keep you guessing about where they are going and what it all means.  Just like real life, the devil is in the trivial details, intentional and unintentional misunderstandings abound, and the irony builds and builds.Many comparisons with the masterpieces are possible (Don Quixote, Candide, Madame Bovary, The Awakening, Bleak House, Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde).  At the risk of destroying something beautiful, over-simplifying, and generalizing something that is unique, one could say these books capture the decline in morals, family, business, legal, and social relationships in the United States and document an accelerated trend toward fragmentation, alienation, stagnation, and decay.Maybe it's because we were bombarded with political advertisements for months on end and our country seems engaged in one crisis after the next, but I found myself thinking that these novels are an extended metaphor for how our political and social life has disintegrated over the last few decades.Something happened that caused serious distrust and a change in values.  It is hard to say what it was (the Vietnam War, Watergate, women's lib, birth control, Bill Clinton's Presidency, etc.), but it happened, and there is no going back.  The change manifested very quickly, so quickly that one must surmise that it was something that resulted from strong forces that had built up over a long period of time.The Republicans have values which are tradition-based and logic-bound.  The Democrats' values tend towards the emotional and they seem to relish challenging traditional beliefs and practices.  However, both parties are afraid of bringing their conflict out into the open and waging an honest and public war for fear of alienating the voters (kids in the case of this story).The Republicans do not understand the full extent to which their values are fundamentally in conflict with the Democrats.  Since the Republicans want to preserve the most basic traditional value of civility (bi-partisanship), they are routinely manipulated and co-opted into various agreements.  And of course, each of these agreements and attempts to compromise ultimately exacerbate every problem, rather than solving anything.In the process of their long-simmering conflict, the Country's infrastructure and viability have decayed (housing, education, economy, governance, law) and the U.S. has split into two rival camps.  The Democrats and the Republicans have such different values, taste and preferences and they distrust each other so much that they can no longer talk to each other in any meaningful way.  Periodically, they go to the court or to vote, but neither side respects the judgment that is rendered, and both sides skulk off feeling victimized.  They live in separate houses in the same town but never talk to each other, except when they have no choice, and even then it is to conduct or conclude some transaction.Considering that I am recommending these novels to my friends and family, I am disappointed that my description sounds so dull and humorless.

This was easily fixable when I plugged in the charge to recharge it but it was a little disappointing. When I turned it on later it worked well and started to explore. I was happy at the empty music library, fresh cleared screens ready for apps to be downloaded, and storage galore! However, all of the last user's personal pictures and videos were still on the device. For the sake of their privacy I deleted everything as soon as I could. Other than that, I can say that I am very content with the Samsung 4-Inch Galaxy Player! My weeks of researching a good media player paid off.Pros and Cons:Pro:- A camera on the front and back- Plenty of room for music and downloads- Access to many free apps- Easily fits in pockets or bags- You can plug in headphones to listen to music individually or use the speakers on the back of the Galaxy Player to share with others-  As I've heard previously stated, it's like a smart phone without the phoneCons:- The screen occasionally dims on its own even when being actively used- Sometimes the music is choppy when there are other applications open at the same time- The background of my screen has blacked out once and I had to re-start the Galaxy Player to reset itHonestly, I would like to say that the positive outweighs the bad. I bought a used one so perhaps someone who bought theirs new would have a little better luck.

And mixed in with the hilarious spoofs of college professors, there are wonderful meditations on what it means to get the insider's point of view. The particular focus is a young politics professor's attempt to get inside the minds of local anarchists, but the insights into this vexed enterprise apply to much of the contemporary world: the vicissitudes of sudden mass movements, celebrities, and scandals, the frantic drive in the mass media and on the internet to uncover everyone's secrets.But of course all this works only because the writing is so good--gorgeous descriptions, attention to sensual details, beautifully evoked scenes and characters. So I'll just end by listing, somewhat at random, a few short examples:...\"[He was] divorced for the flair with which he shined his shoes.\"Joey (mother to son): \"I hope Oregon isn't like Israel.\"Sequoia: \"through the body we reach the spirit, heart, and mind, not the other way around.\"In short, there's a lot going on here!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic Insights into Marriage, Danger, Oregon...Life", "unixReviewTime": 1351036800, "reviewTime": "10 24, 2012"},

The pace of the action, the ingenuity of the pursued and the glimpse of life in a post-apocalyptic world are blended to into a believable whole.

But that does not affect the quality!Pros:No Super Computer Needed: I play this game on an I3 with 2g Ram. The settings i have are set to Low, there is an ULTRA low.Bring a friend, this game is pure co-opThis game has a never ending war between hundreds of players at once, in land, air, armor, and mechanical beings on maps that are legitimately 250+ square miles across.There is no pressure to buy, you can obtain many things relatively quick.Amazing community: Concerned players, and teamwork. The players i have played with will often heal me, repair me, revive me, work with me, give me ammo, wait for me to get in vehicles, and have taught me tips and tricks with respect. They realize that assisting your comrade is better for you both in the long run, you want as many experienced and alive players with you when the big battles ensue.Men and Women come together in respect: TRUE respect, be you woman or man, the players (at least on Mathersson server) have treated me and mine with respect, just because she is a girl nobody has changed the way they treat her drastically, only for the better.NO WHINING LITTLE CHILDREN: You read that right, i have yet to run into a child in the game who whines or acts like the console community children. Even the kiddies who play the game know that respect is key to win.CONS:Crashes, a few bugs, and weapon \"nerfing\". In Beta stage the game crashes at least once a day, which up to now has not caused any damage to my account other than the vehicle i was in dissapearing. Bugs are present in more than one place. Weapons for many factions have been altered to attempt to balance the game but there is still a big margain to balance.Go big or go home: Planetside 2 can be played casually but the biggest battles last 2+ hours.Need a Fast Internet connection: At least 1 mbps.Game requires patience: Not for the 360 quick scope... the battles are such large scales they take time and strategy to accomplish.

I would really like for the series to continue so that we can see what's hidden and what is that screenwriters left for us to discover.Recommend to all, but mostly to CW and SyFy screenwriters, because this is how you make an SF series and not that corn stuff we watch on those networks.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "That's the way series should be written", "unixReviewTime": 1393200000, "reviewTime": "02 24, 2014"},
