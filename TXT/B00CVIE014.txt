This game is O.K. starting out but after you complete all single player missions (about a week's worth of frequent play) you run out of game play. At level 50 you have completed all missions and there are no more. To build a really BIG card takes about 1 million coins, and without any world's to play the only way to get coins is the market. Even so it's fun if you like in depth card development. There is literally an infinite combination of builds.  Doesn't play so well on I-pad 1. Overall fun game, I'm still playing about 4 hours a week after 3 months. And you don't have to spend real money to build really strong cards, just a lot of time. 4 stars. And developers, please open up new worlds, or add harder difficulty to existing ones please.
