I always was a fan of X-Men movies and Wolverine is my favorite character there, so I was very excited to watch this movie. Great fighting scenes, great acting and directing of the movie made it really very involving and interesting till the end. Moreover the end was really unexpected, it seemed that already everything is obvious, but it wasn't. Special effects are always a necessary part of X-Men movies and this time they are not the exception - they were great! Impatiently waiting for the next part.
