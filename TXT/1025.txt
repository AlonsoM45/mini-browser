I was expecting something a little more structurally sturdy.  Once I opened the package I knew it wasn't going to be a good case. The front part is extremely flimsy and broke upon putting on my phone. I do not recommend this unless you are willing to &#34;pay for what you get&#34;. The shipping took too long and was definitely not worth the wait.
