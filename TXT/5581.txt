Looks as though to be a quality product.  Form fit and function are all there and it bolted up nicely replacing the worn out hub/wheel bearings with no major issues.  Time will tell the true quality of the product (and if im bored one day may update) but for the price as of initial install and one day of driving I am very happy.
