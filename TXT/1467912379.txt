Anyone who enjoys delving into the possibilities of the physical and spiritual will surely enjoy this as much as I did! It kept me coming back for more and hating to put it down when I had to. The author did a great job of describing this fantasy world and the nature of the demons who can get hold of our own world, using deceit to make us into whatever they want. Cant wait to see what happens in the next book and if our heroine can defeat what evil has taken hold of her!
