I love the song, and the download has no issues.  What I did have an issue with was that this track has way to many beeps in it.  I didn't realize that I should have looked for a listing with 'explicit lyrics'.  Perhaps if the 'explicit lyrics' track had been listed with the one I actually got, it would have been better.  Thanks for listening.
