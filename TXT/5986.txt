I believe this is a great "backyard mechanic" tool. Coming from a professional mechanic, I bought this tool for home use. I researched many different devises and price. Capability was also a big factor. Being able to download updates online is a BIG factor. The ease of use and the friendly tech support just reassured my original feeling of this tool. The amount of the capability of this tool you get makes it worth far more than the price. Then you still get the tech support on top of that! I am not only extreamly satisfied with my new toy but, YES, I would recommend this devise to anyone with intrest in home OBD2 drivetrain vehicle repairs.
