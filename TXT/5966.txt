This light is one of the best USB lights ive owned. I play PC Games in a dark garage at night, and the Red light is perfect for illuminating the laptop keyboard and whatever else i need to see. The 3 light levels are cool, but the button feels a bit loose and wobbly, but so far has taken all my punishment. The neck is very bendable and twistable and seems to not want to twist at the connection base of the the USB plug, wich is good so the internal cord wont twist up and snap. Overall a great product and the ONLY Red LED USB Light you'll find out right now.
