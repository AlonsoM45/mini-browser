HAD IT FOR 6 MONTHS AND USED IT AROUND 12 TIMES FOR very light short jobs. Just used it to vacuum my car got very hot and stopped working, contacted the company and they said they would send a NEW ONE,will see if they do, and if it last longernot good suction at all, not worth the hassle to use does not get up the dirt, use a broom its better
