These are great for zeroing a scope, pretty heavy duty carboard, instead of paper. The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because they were smaller than I expected, but I was a police officer for 17 years and I'm used to shooting full size targets, it's just me. These targets are more than adiquate for an air rifle or pistol.
