The set of Alpha Tales have fulfilled the purpose for which I bought them.  I was perhaps expecting something a little simpler in the theme of the stories for little ones to understand. Some of the themes I would think are more for around five year olds where as the children I care for are usually two or three year olds sometimes four years old. It would have been helpful to have an age recommendation on them.
