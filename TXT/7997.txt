Ok, so this is the 3rd one I&#699;ve purchased. I own one, and I&#699;ve given two as gifts.Here&#699;s my take... bass is nothing to write home about.  However, this unit is MUCH better than my phone speaker, so when listening to music on my phone...THIS little oontz is better than what I have.  Does it match the sound quality of a Bose or JamBox?  C&#699;mon... let&#699;s be real.  NO.  But then again, I didn&#699;t spend $200 bucks on it either!  And it&#699;s inexpensive enough, that I bought THREE of them, two to give away.  And the teenagers who have the other two...LOVE IT!The one negative I have is that I don&#699;t believe it actually lasts 10 hours on ONE charge. (I think it says that on the manual I got, but I may be mistaken)  I think it&#699;s more like 6-8 hours. Still though... It&#699;s worth $39 bucks.  If you want something that&#699;s better than your iPhone or Android phone speaker... Get this, and buy with confidence.  If you want better bass, and fuller sound reproduction...then buy the Bose.  For me... $39 bucks for something I can throw in my bag and go to the beach with...or give 2 away as gifts...PERFECT!Update:One odd thing... so these two didn&#699;t come with the little carrying bag.  Not a deal breaker, but my nephews both said the bag wasn&#699;t in the box.  Mine came with a nice little felt bag that you&#699;re able to carry all of the cables in, but theirs didn&#699;t.  Like I said, not that big of an issue, if mine hadn&#699;t come with one, they wouldn&#699;t have even noticed but since it did... they brought it up.
