Got my Toshiba television. Took it out of the box and it looked great. Nice style and design. Plugged it in and powered it on. I see the Toshiba logo as its powering on, then I see a black screen. Took a little closer look and I could see the shadow of the menu box. Tinkered with it for a while and finally got fed up. Called Toshiba. Great customer service. Pretty much told me this happens often and its a hardware problem with the screen. Yet to get my replacement from amazon. Maybe that will change my mind.
