Quality, quality, quality and made in the USA! I've used a single fuel version of this stove since i started tent camping over 40 years ago and it was 10 years old when i got it! I tent camp regularly. The stove is simple and when parts wear out they are easily and cheaply replaced which is why they last a lifetime. I'm looking at a new one as a gift.I used a propane stove briefly and had trouble with leaking propane containers and dislike the waste of disposing the metal tanks. After two uses, I went back to using this one. The side guards are very effective in high winds.
