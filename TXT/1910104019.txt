I usually don't read books like this and that's probably the reason why I gave it just 3 stars. I usually look something that I could take for myself from the book. I don't want to say that there is nothing to take from this book, but it's not much. For me this story is more like romance and struggle in love story than a story of human transformation and finding something meaningful in life. It's a classic story of bad boy and innocent girl who finally find each other and the bad boy changes to good side. Many movies are made on this topic and many books are written as well. I usually look for more meaningful lessons or stories in the books.Reading this book it usually seemed that I'm reading some Gothic theme literature, more likely to be some vampire story. It's too much darkness in this book. I understand that it's a novel and it's creative work, but I'm looking from the perspective of what I can learn from this book. And as I mentioned above it's too much to read all this book, just to understand that you are the only one to fight your darkness within.I could recommend this book for people who like dramatic love stories, vampire love stories or similar - you might find it interesting, but as a literature of human transformation and lessons in life, sorry, there are much better books on that purpose.
