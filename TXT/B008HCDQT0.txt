This fits the Trailmaster Limited perfectly.  I live in Hawaii so I need a cover that is medium to heavy duty, that will keep rain (and in turn...RUST) off my smoker.  I&#699;ve seen a number of YouTube videos of smokers that are totally rusted from being left out in the rain.  If you have a Trailmaster Limited, it fits perfectly and it&#699;s priced right.  The Amazon price was actially less than it is at my local Home Depot.  No tax and free shipping.  Can&#699;t go wrong there.
