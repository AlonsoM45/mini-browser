This book picked up right where River and Dahl left off. And another person who had been MIA... It started with a bang! River fought for Dahl with his beautiful lyrics and amazing ways. He truly loves her. The little twists and turns made it so much better! Very amazing read! &#10084;&#65039; River is perfect.. Really.
