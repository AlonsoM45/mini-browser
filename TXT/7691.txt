Ian is a true inspiration and hero!  Words can't describe the power of his music.  His life was cut way too short, but I truly believe God had bigger and better plans for him that this earth could just not fulfill.  Instead, he is a guardian angel who now watches over other young men who stand to lose their life.  It can happen to anybody at any time.  EARLY DETECTION!!  Buy his CD and the book, Together We Will Win, by Karen A. McWhirt.  His story needs to be out there!!
