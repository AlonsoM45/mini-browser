I have had a the same G100 for years, worn as a work watch in really dirty, rough and tumble industrial environment...at the end of the day just shower with it on, scrubb it down and the next day start all over again.  I have worn out several bands which I just replace and good as new.  I like the analog dial along with the easily viewable digital display, as well as the easily accessible stop watch mode, which I use reqularly... for the price... very impressed with the durability and accuracy of this watch, just wear it, use it, scrub it down at end of the day and your good to go again. I have found no issues with its ability to with stand substances within an industrial atmoshere...oils, fuel oil, grease of all types, dust, mud,  solvents, submerged in water, heat, hot and cold weather and never seen the vapor fogging under the bezel that I have seen on other watches in such extreme environments... the bezel glass is still perfect, not all scratched up and foggy, due mainly because it is protected by the high rubber bezel ring surrounding it...The only issue I would comment on is the cost of the replacement G Shock bands, little pricey for a $60 watch, but not as thought you have to replace them reqularly... maybe every few years at most..but definitly the only weak link in the system, IMHO
