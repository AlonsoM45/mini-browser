For some reason this product doesnt work that well with apple tv. I wanted a low profile cable to save space and purchased this one so i can stop using my present cable that is very thick. At times this cable delivers signals and at times it doesnt. At first it seemed like a loose connection issue but it isnt. The cable is secure in the Apple TV and the TV and yet it sporadically looses connection. May be its a bad cable or may be its not compatible with apple tv (dont know how its possible)
