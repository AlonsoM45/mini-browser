My mates use this type angle drill  bit holder for at least two - three years, and it still drives almost perfectly as the first day. We drive it with impact! driver, and we use it every day. Roughly 10-15 hours per week. I use to have cheaper copy of this product and it lasted me for two days! Than it simply fall apart. This is definitely product for tradies! It can get better than this.
