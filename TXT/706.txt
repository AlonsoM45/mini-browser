PRO: Does everything you need it to. Powerlines are a great alternative to wireless networking as long as your electric circuitry isn't all screwed up and they are paired. Great data rates :)CONS: Being in a split level house doesn't help this device at all. Reason why I took a star off is that it drops being paired once a week and is very annoying. Tested with another location with only one floor and the issue still remained.Other thoughts: I like it and I don't mind re-pairing it from time to time. Just wished I didn't have to do that but otherwise it's awesome.
