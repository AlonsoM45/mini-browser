Stress is a usual thing in our lives. Some kind of it might be good and some very bad. It's important to know when stress can help you to progress and when it can harm you.If you don't know anything about stress this book will give you the basic knowledge of what it is. It's like a simple tutorial or an info brochure on this topic, but not a book. What I didn't like about it is that there is not much information on the ways to reduce stress. As the topic says this book should help you to reduce stress and for me it seems that it just gives some information on how to do that. I expect more deep analysis and information from such book.The good thing is that it's short and if you don't know anything about stress you can read this info in one hour. On the other hand, you can find all this info and more in Wikipedia of simply internet, using search keywords &#34;ways to reduce stress&#34;.Wish you a healthy life without stress!
