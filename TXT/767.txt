The &#34;stainless steel&#34; is coming off of the four small spice jars and they are NOT air tight at all, not even remotely air tight. The canisters are very difficult to close and not airtight either. I would defiantly not buy these again. I would recommend paying a little more and actually get something for your money. These canisters were not made to use, they are for decorations.  I wish I had listened to the other bad reviews, they are telling the truth!!
