Hello all,I got this little guy to go with my De'Longhi EC155 15 Bar Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker. My espresso machine is on the small side, so I had to find something that would work for its size- this is perfect!!! It works great and clean-up is a breeze. I highly recommend this one folks! Thank you!
