The day after putting my phone inside this case i started having issues. The case causes the phone to overheat and causes permanent damage to the phone. My phone crashed once, I was not positive if it was the OtterBox so i put the phone back in the case after paying to have my phone fixed. My phone then crashed a second time. I returned to the cell phone repair center and they fixed it again. I did not put the phone back in the case this time and it has worked great ever since until about 20 minutes ago i placed my phone back in the case and within half an hour it has crashed a third time. The damage at this point i dont think is fixable and i will be forced to purchase a new phone soon. Never again will i purchase a product from OtterBox.
