The graphics for the Blu ray version are astounding in my opinion any movie made by Spielberg is a movie worth watching for the tech they had back then they did a lot of good work the dinosaurs look astounding and realistic the animatronics are fantastic whenever the t rex is in a scene it has power and feel to it and will have any child gripping his chair with white knuckles the soundtrack is amazing and beautiful it has the large feeling that was mandatory for a movie like this I am going to say that in my opinion Jurassic Park is the best movie ever.
