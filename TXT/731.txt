I'm currently reading this as a book club choice and not enjoying it at all. Maybe because (luckily) I'm not in a position to understand the trials and tribulations of dealing with a sick old parent. I felt the author whined constantly and showed her worst side in this book. In parts she almost seemed mean to her mother. I'm not sure which parts people were reading that were humorous. I certainly haven't found them. Utterly depressing and dull. I don't think I'll finish it, which is almost unheard of for me! Looking forward to hearing what my fellow bookclub members think...
