This is the first book I've ever read by Jay Bell.  It won't be my last.His command of language, his ability to write beautiful prose, is inspiring.  I found myself going back and retreading passages.  Committing lines to memory.  Highlighting phrases I want to revisit.If you love good writing or want to be inspired to write, read this book.  The characters are people you'll want to know better.The only regret I have, is that it's done.
