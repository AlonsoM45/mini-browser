My wife gave me a Kindle Fire for Christmas, and I installed the Facebook app then before reading the reviews.  I encountered the same issue with the news feed as the others.  Disappointed, I uninstalled, and just browsed to Facebook.Tonight, I decided to try it again, and was pleased to see that the bug is fixed, and the app now works properly.  I decided to write this review, so others won't think it is still broken without trying it.
