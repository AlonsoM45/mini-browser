This effort put forth by the author clearly involved her soul and I highly recommend this to anyone who feels afraid to follow their heart. This book is raw and honest to the core. It leaves no stone unturned in telling one person's journey to the other side of the world with only herself as her guide. The lessons within can be applied to any journey no matter if its Singapore or to that next job interview down the street. It teaches courage, self confidence and realization of oneself. In it is found internal struggles that all humans face when taking any kind of leap to where they want to be. It tells us how to make something out of nothing. Not everyone will succeed but we all must try. In that we will be satisfied.
