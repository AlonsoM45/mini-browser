Forgetting for a moment that I horribly misspelled a Mary Poppins song just now, let's talk about Federation! This book is awesome! It is crafted to look like a history book (From the Next Gen era) detailing the events from Cochrine's first warp flight, to Captain Kirk's death (And possibly further, I haven't read through the whole thing yet). It has an introduction by ADMIRAL Hikaru Sulu (Not sure if actually George Takei's voice, I tried to listen closely and honestly, it's a tossup) describing the book and feeling rather honored. It comes with some cool &#34;artifacts,&#34; like a letter from Jim Kirk to his mother and the envelope to a bill that Zephram Cochrane wrote on (His famous, &#34;Where no man has gone before&#34; speech). Perhaps my favorite part is the chapters about the founding of the Federation and the Romulan War. Ya know, the stuff they WOULD have gotten to in season 5 had Star Trek Enterprise not been cancelled RIGHT before it was to start getting really good. But I digress, the book is a must have for any Trekkie. So if you guys haven't gotten it yet, get it NOW!!!!!
