Long ago I bought the XP version of this book.As it saved me a fortune I bought the Vista version for use with my wifes new  Vista laptop. I personally am staying with XP. Since the demise of system hand books there is a need for books that give clear &#34;how to do it&#34; instructions and examples and this series is well above average in this respect. This book is not only for the aged and wrinkled but anyone that has been lumbered with this computer operating system.
