I enjoyed this book. It brought me back to my past where I identified with the main character in terms of her feelings and coming of age. I did find Delaney to be unworthy of her but can't say its a crime for a girl to fall for a person who has flaws. Ultimately he is also coming of age and realizes the value of this person. He learns.  It's very real. I enjoyed this book very much and look forward to the authors next novel!
