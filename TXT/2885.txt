If you are looking for a deep strategy game, look somewhere else. But if you want a simple to learn and fun to play game, then this dice game is worth the price.In Zooloretto Dice Game you are responsible for populating your zoo with various animals. These animals show up on the special dice you get with the game. The rules are simple. Roll the dice and then decide which dice go onto which trucks. Then, select which truck delivers animals to your zoo. Score points for animals you bring in, or tickets you sell, but don't overpopulate your zoo. That can lead to losing points.My 7 year old daughter loves this game. It's an excellent way to teach children a bit of strategy and planning.
