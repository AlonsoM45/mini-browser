I purchased this as a Christmas present for my father over the holidays. He had a it about 2 to 3 weeks and it quit working. The screen became discolored and then it crapped out. I emailed the seller to see if I can return it and I heard nothing back. I emailed him in January. I still have the tablet sitting in a drawer. I do not recommend this product. I would really prefer my money back to be honest. Hope this helps you all.
