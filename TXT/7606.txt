This is one of Lynn Reds master pieces. OMG this book will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. There are parts of this book that will make you just laugh. I just love Atlas he is so well you will have to read it to understand. Well done Lynn Red. I was gifted this book for a honest review. I liked it so much I went back and bought it also.
