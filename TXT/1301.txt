I got these lights to hang in my room as an alternate light source. When I first took them out of the package I was very skeptical but once I plugged them in I really liked them. They are the beautiful cool blueish-white lights that I was looking for. I strung them up behind sheer white curtains, on my wall, and it looks absolutely beautiful! Wish I could share a photo. Everyone that has seen my bedroom setup tells me that it looks so relaxing and calming with the way I have everything. I also put up a canopy to finish the look I was going for and the lights shine beautifully bright behind the layers of fabric. I am in love with my bedroom! The lights give off enough light to move about and eliminate the need to always have my bigger lights on. My only issue was that the plug looked kinda weird and was a little loose in the socket but I easily fixed that my bending the prongs a little out ward and it fits perfectly now. I just ordered 3 more sets of lights.
