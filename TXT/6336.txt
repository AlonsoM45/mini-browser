Purchased this as a place for my toddler to hang his things, and for that purpose it is perfect. However, I'd think twice before hanging anything too heavy on it. It's cute, and a great knockoff in comparison to it's higher-priced predecessor from Eames. My only real complaint is that the screws it came with are of extremely poor quality, and with one twist of the screwdriver, they stripped. Purchase yourself some decent hardware for hanging.
