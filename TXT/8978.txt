I chose this rating because they are practical and work relatively well for at least being seen by drivers however I would not ride and rely solely on the front light to see which you would expect for this price.  The one pitfall I came across was when fitting it onto my bike, the attachments or at least the screws were relatively small and I had to replace them with longer ones.  All in all, well worth the money spent
