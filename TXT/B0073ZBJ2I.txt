I normally wear a size 61/2. All the reviews said that they run big so I ordered a 6. They fit PERFECT. Unlike the old Dr. Martens, the leather is very soft and comfortable. The sole is not as prominent as the old Dr. Martens which makes them less bulky looking. I wore this boot all day when I received them. This is definately a must have if you want a good looking and VERY comfortable boot. Shipping from Amazon was super fast also.
