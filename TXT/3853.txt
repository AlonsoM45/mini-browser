I inhaled this book! The plot was riveting and the ending was as it should be. Well done! I may be biased because I grew up in Spencerport as did the author, and loved the references to it and the surrounding Rochester area. That being said, this is the kind of book that you don't want to end, and immediately think &#34;this would make an awesome movie&#34; as soon as it's finished. Thank you David for writing such a riveting and thoroughly enjoyable book. I will be sharing it with my family!
