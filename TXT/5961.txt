This is a poorly made splitter. After some light use, the black casing will slide off exposing the insides, and no matter what, if you use multiple devices at once, one of them will get distorted sound, as if there's a short somewhere. The ports are too close together, which means any cords that you plug in must be low profile like this device. And lastly, the 3 sectioned jack doesn't like to work right on some devices, like phones and mp3 players, and older devices from back in the day.The only pros i can think of is the low profile design, abnormally strong and sturdy cable, and sleek look. Other than that it kinda sucks.
