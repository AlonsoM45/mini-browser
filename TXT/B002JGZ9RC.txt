So far, the other reviews are dead on. I played music first and wasnt extremely impressed. Put in avator'' the cat trying to kill him scene''and wow! You can feel the tree's cracking and the gun shots...what! The speakers put you there. I'm hard to please and i feel for ''out of the box'', this is a great speaker. I'm sure they will get better after the break-in period.
