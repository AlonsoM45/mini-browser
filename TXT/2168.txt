1. Awesome Product for the price. Strong and perfect for those deep knots all athletes will have. Seriously, if you don't think this is strong and doesn't work out the knots around your body, you're either using it wrong, somehow, or you need to get yourself a PVC pipe. Enough Said.2. Unfortunately you may have one side sawed off.  I used a finishing spray on the end so that it doesn't degrade. Works pretty well and no stray foam is fallen off and I've used it a handful of times. So, pretty lame, but it's not falling apart at all.Big turn off, I have to say about it being cut. However, this is an excellent product for the price and works extremely well. Try finding another high density foam roller for this price. I actually did AT MY GROCERY STORE???. Idk how that happened, but i found it there days after I purchased this and it was 100% intact. I kicked myself in the ass for that one. But oh well. This is a Great product and I have zero complaints besides that.**You may read on here that it's not that hard, but trust me, I've been rolling for a year now, and this roller is the next best thing to a PVC pipe. It's a great price and is very strong. I weigh 165 - 170lbs, can stand on top of this roller and it gives very very slightly, obviously, it's foam, but it's not going to fail you and indent after heavy use.
