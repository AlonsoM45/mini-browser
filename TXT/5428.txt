When I saw the release for The Bones of Others, I had recently finished reading the Evil Trilogy (which by the way, was fabulous, keeping me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire series) The name sold me and Vickie didn't let me down.  This was a great story with plenty of action suspense and romance. So excited for the next one!!!!
