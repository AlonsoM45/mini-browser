Comfortable and stylish. Good to wear for casual or dressy. Good fit and height. The incline is comfortable and doesn't cause any pain during wear. The height of the heel is about 2 3/4 inches and was perfect for me (5' 4&#34;) so I could pair them with a long maxi dress. I would highly recommend these, especially for those who want more height but are not used to wearing heals.
