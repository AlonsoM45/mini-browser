So the screen itself is OK. it is an actual screen. Very grainy though but it does the job. The back of the screen is black so no light is going to pass through it which to some is good to some its not. it is heavy and sturdy and that is the sad part too. The spring or the coil that is supposed to keep the screen rolled up is very very weak. So once I am done using the screen if i roll it up it still drops/rolls down quite a bit. there is a metal or wooden rod that is in the bottom of the screen. It is supposed to keep the vinyl in shape and stretched. This rod is very heavy and the coil cant bear its weight so it unwinds. Defeats the purpose of roll down screens. If the coil worked i would give this 5 stars.The arrangement i have is i have used L brackets to hang this from the wall over my window. The whole idea was to use the screen when needed and else roll it up to let light come through the window. now since its half way rolled down; i cant seem to utilize my window. Anyways the set up is very heavy and i lost the box so cant even return it. but if you have other options i would look elsewhere. This screen is cheap for a reason.
