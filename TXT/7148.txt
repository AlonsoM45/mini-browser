Wasp Freeze really works.  It seems like professional strength.  It kills wasps and hornets on contact.  Just spray it on the nest at night when the wasps and hornets are in the nest, they will come out of the nest already dying.  Keep on spraying and they will die within a couple of seconds.  You can spray from about 6 ft. to 10 ft. away from the nest.  It sprays in a fairly heavy stream, not in a mist.  I also killed a big spider with it.  I highly recommend this product.  It is worth the money.
