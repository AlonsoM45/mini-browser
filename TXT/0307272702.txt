This is a well structured book with a clear, scientific thesis to its credit.  The rationale is well built up  and leaves one with the sense that  this is a manageable  process , maybe repetitive  in parts but  not a strain to read and think about.  Unlike many such books  it leaves a thoughtful residue which affects  what one buys  and what one eats.  That is a very good outcome.I could recommend it to friends and those concerned to manage their overall health issues, not just the question of losing weight.It must be a good read as I have returned to read it again several times.
