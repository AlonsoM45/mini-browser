This game has as many quirks and defects as a game could get.  The graphics and illustrations look like they were done by an 8 year old.  The story is wild and wierd.  Unfortunately, it's just not good enough to play without a few beers.  You'll find the control and special moves in particular are awkward, and if you never heard of Jo Jo's Bizarre Adventure, this game in my opinion, is no biggie to miss.  If you're a collecter of wierd and random things however, you should buy it.
