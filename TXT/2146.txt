This ammo case is nice, well thought out, I'm adding it to my combat vest outfit, as they say &#34;More Bullets&#34;, really it's a nice rifle ammo case, both my 308 cal. and 30-30 Winchester Ammo fit nicely in it, and it will probably work for many other rifle caliber ammo too.  I give it (5* Rating).JM
