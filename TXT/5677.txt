I was hiking in the mountains outside of Elektro, and I began to get hungry. I had many cans in my green mountain pack, but nothing to open them with (I wasn't going to shoot them open). As I was looting houses I came across one of these bad boys. It opened all of my cans and dispatched some zombies along the way. I have never been hungry since.
