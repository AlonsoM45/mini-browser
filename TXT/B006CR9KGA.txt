Sometimes it dribbles a little water, but otherwise I love this product. I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend, but it ended up also being a gift to myself. I use it all the time when I need to quickly rid my clothes of wrinkles before work or going out. It heats up super quickly and really gets the job done.I've found it works best when I lay my clothes flat on a bed and use it like an iron.
