I have had the Keurig mini, B-60 and B-70 special editions. I loved the SE but it took up too much space, as I am the only coffee drinker in the home. I would have never bought this machine if I knew the trouble I was going to have.. Right away the first 3 kcups I used the cup did not even fill halfway and the coffee looked like water.. the machine does not punch into the kcup from the top. I then tried Apple Cider and the same thing.. I have to puncture the kcup myself.. Its just not a good machine. It leaks from the top and honestly I would spend 15 more next time for a different brand.
