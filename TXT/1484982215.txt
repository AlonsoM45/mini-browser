Loved this book!  A great read for anyone who has ever asked the age old question, &#34;What is life all about?&#34;Connecting his own personal experiences with detailed research, David Gaggin writes thoughtfully about his search for the truth and invites the reader to do the same.  Interesting and unique perspectives on spirituality and this journey we call life-  I would recommend to anyone who is open minded and curious about their connection to others and to the universe.
