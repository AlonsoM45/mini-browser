I bought the conditioner and shampoo because on the bottle it says it works great on hair extensions. For me these did NOT do good for my extensions. I had real hair in and when I used these it dried them out and made them feel really terrible. it was really bad. lesson I learned, just because it says you can use extensions doesnt mean you can. If your looking for stuff more for extensions try Suave, its the best :)
