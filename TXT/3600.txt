This is very well done as a missionary story.  If you are a missionary as I am, you will enjoy it.  I particularly enjoyed seeing the family in action - reminded me of my daughter and son-in-law in Suriname, South America, where they have a ministry involving their nine children.  It is not a drama, however, if that is what you want.
