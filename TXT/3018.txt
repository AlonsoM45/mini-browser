I have owned one of these before and really liked it. My previous one had fallen in toilet and got ruined. Great sound quality. I can hear callers perfectly and they can hear me. I love that I can hear the callers # thru my headset and voice call by the push of a button. only wish it would say my contacts name but it doesn't do it for android 2.3 or higher. Other than that it's great/
