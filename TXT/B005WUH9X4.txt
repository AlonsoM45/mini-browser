This is the first time I've ever written a review about anything, but after the horrible experience I've had with this case, I'm hoping to save a few other people some frustration.  I had trouble right away with this case.  First, the screen portion had air bubbles in it and was wavy, making it hard to use the touch screen on the phone.  Then, when it got so bad that I couldn't press the END button to end a call, I decided to contact the company. After waiting on hold for about twenty minutes, the CSR informed me that it was a counterfeit case.  So, since this was given to me as a Christmas gift, I'm not the only victim... my mother in law, who gave it to me, is out the money she paid for it.  I am beyond aggrivated at this point.  Please, DO NOT buy this case.
