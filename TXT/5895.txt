When she was younger, my daughter refused to sleep in deep cribs, so I bought the travel bed before I went oversee to visit family.The bed survives the travels well. Easy to fold and unfold, easy to carry and very comfortable. We took it to grandparents, to road trips, and sometimes just for living-room sleeping.Be warn, though - it is light weight, so when the baby starts crawling - it is time to store the bed for the next one. :-)Also: we always put it low - floor, carpet, mattresses - never where it might tip and fall.
