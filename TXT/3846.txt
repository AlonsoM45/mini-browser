ok I bought this dvd since it sounded real interesting. A woman raising wolf children. Of first I didn't know what I should think of it since I thought how can a women get wolf children. I was concerned that it would turn out to be a bad animal abusive movie since you hear of so many things of today and people get so many ideas of getting money these days. Well I made a choice to check it out for all of you. In fact after I watched it I had tears in my eyes for the story was not bad at all. It was so much feeling so much love so much well lets say its fantastic. I don't cry easy but this just brought me in different character rolls which I cant explain since I would ruin the movie for all of you. I just can say it was a sweet treat. I always enjoyed watching anime since 20 years and im 26 now and I think if we had more people that would let there children watch anime we would have less crime in our world more then letting them watch the children programs of today. Plus they would learn better things. Don't get me wrong, its great that we have these series but they changed over time, there more over being fun and not of showing our children what love and all the other real important feelings are about these days. But I think you should buy it and check out for yourselfs.
