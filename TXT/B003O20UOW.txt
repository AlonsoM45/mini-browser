Despite several negative reviews, the Hornady Auto Charge works as advertised.  After reading the supplied instructions, the setup was easy, calibration simple, and once the character of individual powders was observed, I was able to drop consistent charges with maybe one overcharge per 20 cases loaded.  A level and solid surface is important to reliable operation. Overall, very satisfied with the unit.
