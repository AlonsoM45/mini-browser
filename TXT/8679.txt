very nice, sturdy units that can be arranged in a number of ways to fit your storage needs.  This looks great on our washer/dryer and it looks so tidy and organized in there now!  Not too hard to put together. Only problem is we were sent smaller sections that I think were supposed to be for the backs, but were too small to fit.
