I loved this book. It was one of those books that you love to jump into and get lost into the fantasy that awaits the characters. From start to finish there is always something going on that catches your attention and makes you want to read more. At times I found it hard to open my kindle and find times to read so it was hard to get into the book again because  I was frequently having to stop. I think this is.  Great read for any fantasy reader.
