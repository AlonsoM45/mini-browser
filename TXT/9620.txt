Fast, able to handle gaming and engineering solid models. I purchased this on my newest PC build with intent for high end gaming with occasional SolidWorks use in Nov 2012.Pros:1. Easy install2. Looks awesome (my PC has a clear section on the case. These help the "why is that not in outer space" impressive appearance)3. Very fast4. Never been able to max it out yet (even with highly graphics modded Skyrim.)5. Still expandable to 32 if your running extensive video and higher level Windows 7 or 8Cons:1. Still a bit price heavy, but I got them Black Friday so no issue for me.
