Great product, very happy with it. Only thing that sucked was the crappy minimal instructions that came with it. Awesome for not adding fingerprints and oils to your screen, huge improvement over the actual screen in this respect. Can tell it is on, but only because you know you applied it, it is seamless, and a wonderful product. Would recommend and will buy again for future smart phones.READ THIS IF YOU ARE INSTALLING IT:1. You get in fact, two screen protectors, one is a backup.HOW TO INSTALL:1. Find a clean work environment, clean the your phone, remove dust, etc.2. Take the screen protector out of it's carrier bag, and place it where you want it to go onto the phone (goes on one way with how it is cut out). It is indicated which side faces up.3. Take the piece of tape in your kit and tape it to the screen protector and to the side and back of your phone.4. The screen protector can now open up like a book. Open it up, and peel off the reverse of the screen protector exposing the sticky part. If any dust has gotten onto your screen, remove it. Place the screen protector back by closing the 'book like' flap closed.5. Remove the final protective cover with the last tab that sticks out, the tape that was attached to your phone will also come off. If you want to, maybe remove some bubbles now with the squeegee.6. Remove final bubbles, and make sure everything is pressed down firmly. You are done.NOTES: The 'dust removal tape' is sticky as all hell... I did not use it because it adhered way way way too strongly. I don't advise using it, maybe get some scotch tape if you really want.
