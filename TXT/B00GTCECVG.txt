I love this game so much, it's so addicting. It's way better than clash of clans. But I've been having a problem with searching guilds. I created a guild and I play on a kindle fire HDX, and my friend plays on an iPhone, but when my friend tries to search my guild it does not show up. It says still searching guild may not exist. That was the whole point in playing this game so that I could play with my friend. Please Fix this. I want to continue to play but this is making it difficult. Maybe it's because amazon doesn't get frequent updates like iPhone and Android do. But I'd really appreciate it if this could be fixed. Ill give it a five star if this gets fixed.
