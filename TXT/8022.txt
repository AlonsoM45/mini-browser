I bought this striping tape thinking I could use it for making designs and creating perfect stripes. When I got it I was so excited. It was easy to place down on my nail. However, when I put the top coat on, some of the color from the tape was gone. Then the tape began lifting and peeling off. I ended up just painting over the tape and peeling it off to create lines. By itself, the tape is not a good nail art tool. When used to make other designs on your nail and then just peel off the tape, though, it works better.
