I love this game. sure it was a little hard trying to find out what to do, but all in all the story is amazing with really good cut scenes. the  controls aren't bad, and the first person shooter mode is cool too. starting in the middle of nowhere in the winter means you do a lot of running in the snow, and you may run out of patience, but if you can just give the game a chance, it' worth it.  Also, if you analyze the game closely, it really feels more like Resident Evil. I think this game was created before those, and the creators of Resident Evil were inspired.  I feel really satisfied and accomplished playing this game, even if i only got the first disc. all in all there's a total of 4 of them, and it will leave you wanting more. It didn't come in the original package, but for the price it was worth it.
