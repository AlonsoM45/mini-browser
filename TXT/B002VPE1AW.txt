One of the greatest movies I've ever seen! Why? Because this movie has everything what you need for a spectacular view. Actors are not superstars, but it's the least important aspect in movie if you have everything else in it's places. The acting is great, special effects are superb, filming and directing has nothing more to add to. The story line is not new or something what you have never heard before in different interpretations. What I love is that even the story is simple, but the presentation and implementation of it is made the best way I could imagine!James Cameron is the director of this movie, and what I love about him is that he has an incredible ability to make masterpieces while many other directors can just make something. One of the most admirable things is that this movie, Avatar, changed the course of movies industry. James Cameron showed everyone that movies can be watched in 3D. He didn't invented 3D technology and I know that. Steve Jobs didn't invented many things too. What makes these 2 men similar and what makes me admire them and their works is the ability to make great masterpieces and change the course of history!I greatly recommend this movie to everyone!
