I choose a five star rating ***** because this book traps you so that when you have to go to the bathroom you rush because it's that good! I like that she compared the story to her life she had staying in an academy school. Dislikes- none! I'd reccomend this book to people who went through hell and sunshine who've had their hearts broken and need to cheer up. To people who don't know the identity of one of their parents. YOU SHOULD READ THIS!!
