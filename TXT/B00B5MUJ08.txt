I love the functions this player has to offer, and works great, connects bluetooth with my ipad and phone with no issues and pretty easy to use, i havent figured out yet how to hook up the DVD player to work, it just flashes e-brake muust be applied, but i didnt hook that wire to anything, may get to it someday.UNFORTUNATLEY, the one feature i really wanted to have, i cannot use, the bluetooth phone system, the calls come great thru the speakers, but noone can ever hear what I am saying unless i shout, and im not a quiet talker, but i have had to stop using it all together because the people im talking to are always complaining they cant hear me.If your looking to use this radio for calls, I would keep looking, there was only 1 review when I bought this, it basically said its decent for a cheapie, so i didnt have much to base it onHope this helps!
