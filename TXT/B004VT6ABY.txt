Purchased this unit for the dry winter months, The first thing I noticed was that the &#34;medicine tray&#34; is just a molded in cup to the top screen of the unit, very disappointing to see sunbeam would actually market this. This unit has no way of controlling humidity levels, it will run constantly under two selections &#34;high&#34; and &#34;low&#34; until it runs out of water... The fact that this unit boils water to raise humidity levels make it very inefficient, I found it much more practical to boil water on the stove to humidify my small one bedroom apartment.After about 5 hours of running, I found that this unit only raised the humidity of a small room by 10%, (tested using a mechanical hydrometer)This unit would be good for a small bedroom that is has few or small windows, and very low air flow.
