Bought this for my girl for Halloween and it fit just like the picture advertised. The wet look material looked really hot and the way the suit stretched to match her curvy body was amazing. I was hoping these suits were legit and not some cheap polyester but they were nice and stretchy so the spandex was perfect. My wife is 5'4 and 125 lbs with D cups so the small was HOT on her!
