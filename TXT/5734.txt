I have had every cologne from armani code to drakkar and I have never had my girlfriend ask me to use it cause she liked the smell. It's a unique smell and definitely not for the truck driver type, or the conservative type, it's for the sporty, athletic type, someone unique willing to stand out...In a good way, it's definitely different, but ladies like it but don't use too much a spray or two will do.
