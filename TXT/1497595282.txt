As a puerto rican myself and having gone through similar experiences as Dante I quite enjoyed this book. I liked that I could identify as some of the things did and do still happen in the island and make this book relatable and believable while still  maintaining the concept of magical realism. I found it really inspiring and thoughtful as it teaches a lot about working hard for your goals despite what hardships life throws at you which make this book wonderful and comforting for the teenaged community who's constantly struggling with issues as the ones presented in the book.
