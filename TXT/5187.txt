The book made a few interesting points along the way, but never grabbed you and made you want to continue reading.  An interesting life I'm sure, but if there was a message here I couldn't find it.  It's almost like the discussion on habitat.  The book was very general  (habitat) and was never specific about any one thing (habitat for a particular species).
