I don't read a lot of young adult fiction so this wasn't a likely purchase for me. I did, however, enjoy the book and found that I connected with the characters and wanted to know how the story unfolded. If you're looking for a light-hearted read with a little romance and a good moral, you'll like Capella Bright.
