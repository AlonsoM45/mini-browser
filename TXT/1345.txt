I really loved reading this! It's a great girl meets boy novel full of lust, and moments of sadness. Madison met Liam and they were immediately attracted to each other and they later on find out that they work with each other! I got to hand it to Christina this was a very well written debut book, if there was any spelling or grammar errors I never caught them because I was too caught up in the book!Two people trying to make something of themselves In the medical field, and they find each other and know things will no longer be the same, they want a no strings attached relationship but that wasn't happening! I was on the verge of tears when Liam left, I was also so mad! He frustrated me at times! I really felt for Maddie. And i also wanted to kill Owen for doing what he did.Overall this was a great debut read and I am REALLY looking forward to seeing what's next for this great author!
