I hope these are the worst shoes I brought in my entire life. They really are a piece of garbage. I bought them to give to my mother and after two weeks of use synthetic upper broke on the edge where strike with the sole. They were unless.  Do not waste your money on this, quality is very bad.  I will never buy this brand shoes again  !!!!!!
