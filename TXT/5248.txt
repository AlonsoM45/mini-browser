Since I'm already a fan of Country Living magazine, I felt that this would be a good source for ideas.  I was not mistaken.  Lots of beautiful photographs to get ideas from.  I would not limit it to &#34;country&#34; alone.  I love English Country and French Country decorating styles, and this book had numerous photographs that easily fit those categories.  Loved it!
