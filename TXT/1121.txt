I heard this album a few times on youtube.com, and decided to purchase it --- albeit used, but for my collection. The reason for doing so is actually a couple tracks, such as Where be Mosada, a sad and dreamy rendition leaning towares hopeful chords - filled with (amazingly perfect!) tremolo use.  I like the up beat Oui Oui Si Si track too.
