I have a 38 ft. 5th wheel and followed the instructions as to where I should put 2 of the stabilizers.  I put 1 additional stabilizer accross the back and one on the drivers side toward the back.  They work great and are quick and easy to set up.  They are compact and easy to store.  I will be recommending them to every one I see.
