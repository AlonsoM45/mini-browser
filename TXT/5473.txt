WOW. Better in person than any pictures show. Very accurate read on it. Took it out of the box, let it get room temp. as is cold here in NY state right now. Worked as soon as i stood on it. Love this scale. Glad i got an extra for my son for a Christmas gift. He is sure to love the upgrade, from his old Cave Weapon of a scale. That is why i bought myself one. My old scale would say you weighed something different each and every time you got on it. Trashed it the day this Wonderful scale came into the house. Thanks OZERI. Wonderful product.
