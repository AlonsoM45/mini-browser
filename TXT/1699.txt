I got this book as a freebie, and I am glad I did. If you want a great, quick read, this book is for you. I didn't find it scary or suspenseful but I had to know what happened next. The author doesn't fill the book with unnecessary information to draw out the story, just gives you a great story. I hadn't heard of this author before and now I am wondering why. As soon as I finished this book I went looking for Sinister Entity and when I finish it I will definitely go looking for his other books. Thank you Hunter Shea!
