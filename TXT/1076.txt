I gave Waiting to be heard a five star review because it was beautifully written and it never steered away from the heart wrenching truth Ms.Knox went through. As she aches and fights for freedom it she manages to stir that up in reader as well. I recommend this book to everyone  it's  story people of any age need to. It serves as an important piece of history.
