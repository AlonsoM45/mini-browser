So glad I bought the costume! The only down side about the costume is the sizing.  I'm 5'5", 138lbs...and i usually wear medium. Since they didn't have just a medium i went with the med/lg and it's def a little big in the chest area, so I wore a light blue tank top underneath it and it was perfect!  The zipper wasn't an issue for me at all.  All you need to do is fluff up the skirt when you get it.  The hood was in great condition, that just needs a little fluffing up too. You def need to get the leg warmers with the costume.  I wore this to a halloween party and everyone loved it!
