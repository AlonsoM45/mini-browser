The fit is really good but it does come with extra ear pieces just in case you should need a different size. The sound is really good and the bass is surprisingly good as well.  For the price it's hard to beat.  These in ear headphones actually compare reasonably well to some over ear headphones.  For the price I was actually expecting a weak bass sound but these are really good.  I've had these for a while now and they're still kicking and sounding great.  I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for some incredible headphones but don't want to pay over $100.  These are just as good as some of the $100+ headphones.  You won't regret it.
