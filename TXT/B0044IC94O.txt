I looked at alot of reveiws and talked to freinds who bought this suit. Living in northeast Wisconsin I needed a suit that would keep me warm when fishing on the frozen tundra. The frabile icesuit is by far the best suit I ever owned. The construction was great and so was the fit. I would recommend this suit to any outdoor adventurer.
