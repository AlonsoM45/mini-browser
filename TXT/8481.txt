Great book and guide on very important lessons in life. Most people struggle with their lives, jobs, relationships, happiness and so ever. I believe this book can really help most of them if they will read it sincerely for themselves and put those advises into action. The Greatness Guide is quite similar to another Sharma's book Who Will Cry When You Die. For me it wasn't much difference, but I believe that the more such books everyone will read, the more chances to live a great life he will have! Recommended to everybody searching greatness in all aspects of life!
