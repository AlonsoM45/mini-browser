I really LOVED this book. And there are several reasons:First, good reading. It s very interesting just to read this book - interesting to follow life and development of writer, to know about unique personal experience of Liu PingSecond, very educational. It shows China from completely different point of view. You see from inside all historical events took place in China thrue the eyes of real reagular people who lived them throe. We (westerners - as we are called in the book) don't have real picture of the country, its culture and people. And book of Liu Ping opens your eyes and make you think different. After this book I decided to read more about China - about it's history - so similar and at the same time so different from RussiaThird, very emotional. This book gives you so much positive enegry, fills you with optimism and desire to live your life and fight for your dreams. It motivates you to work hard and study more to improve your professional skills and make personal growth.So, I would stongly recommend this book to everyone who is interested in world history and looking for insperation. And for all who want to read about unique and motivating life story of success.
