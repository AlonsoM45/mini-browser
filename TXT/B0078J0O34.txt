its cheap and its protecting my vita against bumps and scuffs hear and their and it looks tight in blue.  while it wont absor shock from a significant fall itll protect against 7 yr olds man handling it. it looses a star because you cant hit the volume and power buttons unless you have like long nails or press hard on the buttons. but its no big deal really i recommend this. oh and its easy to install!
