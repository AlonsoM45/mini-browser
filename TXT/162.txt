I had ordered a set of 11 books for a Sunday School Class. It seems to be a good book, but when I received the order, the pages and chapters on most of the books were all mixed up. I returned the books and asked for replacement books, but the replacements had exactly the same problem. I was then told that I would receive a refund and that I needed to find another supplier. The quality control was terrible, and it was even worse to find that the same problem existed on the second book after I had told Amazon exactly what was wrong with the first set. I have received a refund, but that is small consolation.
