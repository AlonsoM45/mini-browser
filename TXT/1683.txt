This one definitely made it into my favorites list. While it is one of your typical boy meets girl, they fight, and then discover they are made for each other, it still has  so much more.  The author wove the story and characters together in such a way that kept me coming back to see what they'd do next. I really enjoyed Caitlyns interactions with the ghosts. Amazing find! I highly recommend this book.
