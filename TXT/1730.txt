I got this for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift because he's been wanting to get a big tattoo but he doesn't have the funds for it. Naturally, I saw this as a very fitting gift for him. It's bigger than I had expected, which is good because then it can hold more change. All in all, it's a cute and funny lil' bank and it did make me crack up when I took it out.
