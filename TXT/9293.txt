its been about 2 weeks now and my tf700t is doing good with the new armorsuit.  The application process is a bit scary cuz u gotta put all this liquid on your tablet before applying the screen protector.  oh and you gotta wait 24 hrs to use the tablet after application wtf is that i gotta wait 24 hrs to see if all this liquid didnt kill my tablet??? nah son!!!  its cool i guess cuz you can take it off and re apply it and it does look good after a few days of setting in. but liquid and tech dont mix and for that it looses a star. if you want to buy this youll be happy with it after the scary process of applying it.
