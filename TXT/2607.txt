Great documentary. Finally a documentary that covers the subject of melanin. Very factual. Each commentator is exact and on point with information. Learned so much I hadn't learned before. Dr. Booker T Coleman and KRS brought nothing but truth. I plan on buying another copy for my friends and family.
