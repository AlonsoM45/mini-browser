I love this game. The only thing I would ask the makers to change is to make it so youre able to start a new game. I've deleted and downloaded it 3 times already (only had to pay once) just so I could play again once I finished it. If the makers are reading this please make an update that allows you to play again so that I so that I don't have to keep deleting and redownloading
