We get this jeans but they are not low rise and not Straight. They're high rise and slim. In general quality is good though fabric is rather thin. Maybe it was a mistake of Amazon who shipped us another item...As we cannot return them now, my husband can wear them but feels a little bit disappointed as expected another model.
