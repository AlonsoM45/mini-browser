Ok so when I saw this I was really skeptical, even with all of the good reviews. I wasn't sure that this little angled speaker could put out decent sound...BUT IT DOES! it doesn't sound tinny or weak....and holds up to louder volumes and doesn't distort when you think it will.The first day I got it, i was supposed to do a workout class in a room with a 70" TV. Unfortunately someone else booked the same room and had 25 people in there for a workshop....so i moved my little workout group of 8 to another room without a TV. I hooked this up to my computer and played the workout DVD (Insanity!) where the instructor is giving directions AND there's music playing...and we had NO PROBLEM hearing all of it.  The room was FILLED with sound! It was the tiny 15" screen that was difficult!Sure it's not a Bose speaker, or Beats pill, or the new Sol Republic deck.... But for only $39 bucks....I can buy FIVE of these little babies for the price of ONE of those. It just so happens that I saw the commercial for the Sol Deck on the same day I ordered this...and I said to myself: if this doesn't perform, I'll return it. So  I kept the packing material just in case. But after that first emergency use.... I'm sold. I threw all the packing stuff away and I'm keeping it! I can already forsee using it on the beach, poolside, with my laptop when watching a movie, etc.Look... It's bluetooth, battery operated, compact, and inexpensive. It'll even function as a handsfree speaker for your phone! And did I say it was only $39 bucks??!!  BUY WITH CONFIDENCE.  And if you&#699;d rather spend $200-300 bucks on a Bose, Beats, or Sol, go ahead and do it if that&#699;s your budget or preference.  For me... $39 bucks is GREAT, and I won&#699;t worry if it gets wet or banged around in my computer bag.
