I love the Grinch and I was happy last year when I found they are now selling the Grinch Village. I bought two houses last year and now I decided I want some people. The quality is great and they are very detailed. I feel that these items will eventually be collectors items later in life. They add great charm and happiness to the Grinch Village and look just like the Whos from the orginial Grinch.
