I love Mercedes Lackey, always have.  I've read the print version of these books years ago so I know the rather disturbing quantity of typos I found are only in the digital copy.  There were sometimes pages worth of words that had m instead of rn or something similar.  Most of it was still decipherable in context so I only experienced momentary irritation.  Otherwise, still one of my favorites.
