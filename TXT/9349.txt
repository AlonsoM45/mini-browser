just ordered the 22" premium 2 hose hookah (ocean blue), everything was great, shipping came right on time, everything looks great, then on the 2nd day, we decided to clean the hookah, and all of a sudden it shattered on us. I am unable to locate a number to contact for the supplier and am not sure what to do, not happy with the fact that the product shattered on us, i hope a refund or they can replace this for us.
