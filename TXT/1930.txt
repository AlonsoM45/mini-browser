Another new giant, Bouncer joins the tech element. He has finger pistols kinda like Trigger Happy. He can also fire off rockets from his shoulders. Later in the game, you,ll get an "I-beam" (basicly eye lasers). He is a good skylander for long range attacks and as well for button-masher people. He has a path about futher devoloping his rockets (which I choose) and one for his fingerguns and lasers. Overall , I think Activision needs to go back to the drawing table and make a change because you should expect more more from a giant than this ( please don't sue me Activision). Well there might be a reason why they did this.  Also see my Trigger Happy review for anyone who reads this or just likes to button mash a lot.Leave comments or questions on Skylanders Giants. :-)
