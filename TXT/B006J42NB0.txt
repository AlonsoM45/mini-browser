My husband likes this product and has used it off and on for 30 years. He says that it is the only thing that makes his hair lay down without feeling greasy or stiff. He ran out recently (a little goes a long way) and we could not find it locally. So off to the internet we go.  After searching, we decided to buy it from Amazon.
