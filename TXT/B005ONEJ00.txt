I wasn't sure they would be bright enough to light the interior of my small rv. They surprised me. I cut the strip in half and ran one down the underside of the cupboards on each side. Used a male plug from the charger of an old cordless drill I had for one and the female out of the drill for the other. Hooked them up,ran them to a switch and it's as bright as day in there in the middle of the darkest  night. I would recommend these to my friends and anyone else who wants inexpencive lighting for a motor home  or anything 12vdc. I need no other lights in mine.. Thanks, It's been my pleasure.
