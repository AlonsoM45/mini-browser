Apparently everyone who wrote a review received a different product, some got knock off xbox controllers, I myself recieved a very poor knock off of a PlayStation controller. You know its bad when its not even a knock off of the product you were trying to purchase. Terrible dead zones, weird drivers, etc. This was a poor and stupid purchase made at the last second. Don't make my mistake!Sending it back as soon as I can, I'll spend the extra money to get an official one.
