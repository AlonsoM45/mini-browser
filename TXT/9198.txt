I bought this case because i liked the fact that it was a dual protector and stylish.  It arrived on time and was packaged well. I ordered a few things from this company and all i kept waiting for was my phone case (bc i was excited) . I have the Verizon LG G2 and this case was very easy to put on, its not to bulky. This is a big phone to begin with and i was worried the rubber piece would be to big with my phone in it for the hard case to snap on, but it all fit perfect, i am very satisfied with this company and all my products i purchase from them. I recommend purchasing from them.
