These bars arrived quicker than anticipated but for my preference, were not very tasty. I kept in mind the nutritional value of the bar as well as the high protein content and low carb for certain activities that I wanted to use them for. Mostly I used them for recovery. The flavor was not coconut but just a bland tasting chewy substance.  They weren't untolerable but I just had to tell myself they were beneficial and will definitely order Quest again, just a different flavor!
