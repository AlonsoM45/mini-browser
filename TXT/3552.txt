I just bought this last week for use in my son's graduation for use on my X-T1.  I was able to sit about 5 ft from people and get a clear zoom on their faces without any shake.  For shots about 50 yards away, I was able to get full body shots.  The colors came out very clear.  The lens is heavy but after getting use to it, it was not an issue.
