I find it hard to believe that "Lesson in Romance" is Harmony Evan's debut novel. It has exciting plot twists, passionate love scenes, funny moments, and tender heart-breaking relationship advances. I like how the author shows you what is happening from both Cara's and Alex's perspectives and ignites you with the fire from their chemistry together. To me, one of the features that distinguishes this book from other authors is the description of the setting and the atmosphere. I really feel the author truly comprehends the magical (and sometimes blatantly financial) world of music and music composition, as well as the pressing issue of illiteracy, which somehow continues to exist in our first-world country today. This is more than a thrilling romance novel - Harmony Evans gives us a peek into the bright world of music while also showing us a glimpse of how pressing dark issues like illiteracy and gangs persist today. But - man - Alex can 'play my instrument' anytime. Phew!!  I can't wait to read Harmony Evan's next book!
