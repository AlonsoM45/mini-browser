Although I have not seen this movie, I can tell you the original songs on this soundtrack are positively amazing. The Christmas songs will be a nice addition to my Christmas musical collection with the rest of the soundtrack taking up permanent residence on my Ipod. Don't miss out on this diamond in the rough, give it a try and be as pleasantly surprised as I was.
