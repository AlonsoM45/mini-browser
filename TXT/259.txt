The replacement lamp was just what I needed.  I was not sure what the problem was to begin with, but when I called different businesses to find out if they carried this lamp, one individual suggested I go to Amazon to order the lamp.  Amazon had the best price and the lamp was so easy to install.  My 10 year old grandson helped me with it.
