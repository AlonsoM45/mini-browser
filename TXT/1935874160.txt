Don't you just love a novel that hooks you from the very beginning and will not let you go until the last page? And when the story is over, you pick up another book and it is equally as engrossing. There are lots of books like that. But every now and again something else happens. A different kind of book winds up in your hands. You come across one of those rare creations that will completely turn you inside out and tie your heart in a double knot. And when you've finished reading it, it takes a while for you to recover before starting another book. I finished Televenge a few days ago and I can tell you this--I am still recovering. Pam has the ability to string words together that pierces every emotion in the reader. I found myself laughing over the down home southern humor. I found myself heartbroken and shedding tears by the buckets. I found myself afraid of turning the page, not knowing what was on the other side. But turning the page anyway because I couldn't stop reading. I found myself forgetting to breathe. Pam hits the bull's eye with her blunt truths that she brings to the page. The story takes you beyond normal. Beyond intriguing. Beyond stunning. Televenge is one of those rare creations that I live for.
