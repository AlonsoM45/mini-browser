I WAS NOT THE LEAST BIT HAPPY WITH THIS "BOOK"REVIEW OF THE MOVIE...WHAT I WANTED WAS THE DVD MOVIE...NOT SOMETHING I'D HAVE TO READ.  I WAS GOING TO RETURN IT, BUT NO LONGER HAD THE ORIGINAL PACKAGING AND I HAD ALREADY OPENED IT , WO WATCH...NOT READ. (SO, I FIGURED I AM STUCK WITH IT, WHETHER I LIKE IT OR NOT.)
