This book was great. I got it for the kids but as I was previewing the book I started laughing. You can't help yourself! As you read you say to yourself this is what  this friend does and that one is done well by that friend. My husband likes to rate burps, but I really think Tristan has given kids, and adults, a start at setting up a fart rating system. Will definitely be looking for book two.
