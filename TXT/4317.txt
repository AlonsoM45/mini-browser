The greatest Spiderman game ever made? I don't know about all that.  However, back in the day when we were playing the Nintendo 64, this game was a pretty big deal.  I always wanted to see this game redone with perfected graphics, and the Dreamcast version comes pretty close to it.  I mean, it looks like PS2 basically, and this game started 64 bit.  Nice going, Sega.  You're SpiderMan and of course what does Spidey do? Wall crawl, explore the skylines, beat up baddies, challenge villains, and rescue damsels in distress all the while managing a hectic college life and part time photo journalist.  In this game you save hostages, climb, swing, crawl and explore various levels while encountering different other Super Heroes such as Daredevil, Punisher, and Black Cat.  You fight a variety of Spider Man villains; namely Dr Octopus, Mysterio, Venom, Scorpion, Rhino, thugs and snipers.  It has a lot of beating up and switch finding in it.  Surprisingly the control scheme is alright though a couple spots here and there can be a little confusing as to where you're supposed to go.  It's a classic beat em up game, with original voice casting from the show.  Listening to Stan Lee narrate is always cool, and it has a lot of features from other Marvel characters.  The biggest improvement is the graphics.  They were terrible on the N64.  So if you want a better looking version of this game that has pretty much no control trouble and a fast paced, easy and exciting story to get into, this game is for you.  By the way, the Carnage battle at the end of the game is pretty lame.  So is the run from Dr Octopus at the end.  Just sayin.
