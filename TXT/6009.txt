Pros: Comfortable, slim and small enough to be carry with my laptop, the trackpoint, is to me the best pointing solution today, it's the only that prevents the hand move away the keyboard. The typing experience is very good, and smooth.Cons: Until now the only cons I've found is that the enter key is a bit small and the missing numeric keypad, be aware for some people the palm rest could be uncomfortable.I'd recommend this keyboard to all that spend more than 5 to 7 hours a day using the computer keyboard, is more fast and comfortable that others.Previously I'd bought a Motorola Keyboard, that's also came with a sort of pointing stick, but the lack of the scroll button, makes this keyboard the winner.Hope you find this review informative to you.
