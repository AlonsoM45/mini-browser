Bought this pair of shoes from Academy. Used them for work because my other shoes kept giving me cramps in my feet. I used them for almost a year and the concrete surface I wear them on has worn them down and needed a new pair. I have had no problem with these shoes. They have been wonderful to wear. I couldn't find them in a local store so I went online. I was very happy to order another pair. I don't usually like paying a lot of money on shoes but these shoes are worth it. The only shoes I wear for work now.
