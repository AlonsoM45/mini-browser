This sub is grreat i just installed it the other day and i already love the thing. the aluminum box resonates the sound really well. there is a metalic ring after a big hit occasionally but it isn't a bad sound i actually kind of like it. the sub was extremely easy to hook up and get wired in, the only problem i ran into was getting passed my anti theft deck. The port on the front improves the clarity a lt and the design is kick ass this is deffinetly a good buy for the price. i just wish shipping was cheaper >.&lt;
