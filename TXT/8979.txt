I've had my eye on these sleeping bags for a while and finally decided to buy them (one left & one right zipper) for camping this summer... It was by far the best purchase I could have made! I was worried that it might be a tight squeeze for two people and that we wouldn't be able to move much. Boy was I wrong! I have a queen air mattress and when these sleeping bags are zipped together, they actually hang off the side of the bed. They are fairly light weight but completely warm. Between an air mattress and these sleeping bags it was like sleeping on a cloud. Everyone who camped with us wants one now. I would recommend this sleeping bag to anyone.
