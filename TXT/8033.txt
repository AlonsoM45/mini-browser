My wife and I had some really crappy wifi out of our internet provider router but now we can go just about any where in our house and still be connected.Setup: This item was really easy to set up. By plugging this into the wall and connecting using your laptop you simply type in the URL included in the manual and you will have access to all the settings of the device! This takes 5-10 mins to set up as an extender or router.Dual Purpose: This can be used as an extender as I am using it for or it can be set up as a new router. I have tested this as a new router, and it worked amazing. I decided not to keep this set up as a router because I was just needing internet on a single device. If you have multiple devices being used on your internet setting it up as a router would be a great idea.Design: This is very solidly desinged and also looks very stylish. It has indication lights to let you know it is working and also has a ethernet port that you can use to set up a direct wired connection to your computer after you extend the range of the internet.Overall this item is great and really helped me get my internet working around my whole house! The best part of this item is you can unplug it and take it to a different room without having to set it back up as a repeater. This is a mobile wireless point so you can always have the best connection possible without having to worry about losing internet!
