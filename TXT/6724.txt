Praying Medic is not just an example but he is a teacher as well. Solid teaching made simple. Hearing what and how others have been through stretching their capacity for God is more than inspiring it is motivating. He leaves you with that feeling this isn't so hard, I think I can do this. My capacity of faith has grown from reading and beginning to apply it more effectively in my own walk. A must read. Thanks, Praying Medic, for putting your heart between the covers!
