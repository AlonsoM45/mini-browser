First, I must say that I won't be talking about the characters very much because I can't do that without spoilers and since this is an ARC copy, I won't spoil anything. So if you want to talk or rant or fangirl about this book and it's characters, please send me a message! I need someone to talk with about this book, lol.The S-word is the brilliantly written debut of Chelsea Pitcher and I can't help but ask... Where in God's name have you been hiding all this time Chelsea? Why did you keep your talent from us for so long? It should be punished... But this book is great, so you are forgiven.Yes, this is a great book. More then that. It's a must-read and one of my new favorites of this year. (Maybe even of all time.) The writing is great and I was hooked to the story from the first sentence. I could not stop reading. I just had to know how it ended. Like I said, I can't talk about it much because I don't want to spoil anything, but I have to say that it did not end the way I thought it would. There are twists and turns I did not see coming. Nothing is what it seems, that's all I can say.I wanted to talk about bullying because it's a big theme in this novel, but I won't. It's bad and mean and low. I hate bullies. That's all.This book is captivating, full of drama and even romance and suspence. Brilliantly written, like I already said and Chelsea, you've got a new fan. I can't wait to read more from you in the future.
