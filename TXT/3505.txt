The installation had an error and it will not run even to uninstall. Total loss of productivity and money. Autodesk's &#34;customer service&#34; is non-existant. Issues are handled via canned FAQs on website, e-mail chat groups which are impotent, or they want hundreds of dollar to talk to someone. I would recommend buying from a Chinese pirate before dealing with Autodesk.
