Pricey!!! I get fleece blankets at walmart for 2 bucks! But I was buying for the character for a handicapped boy who loves scooby doo he cant play with much so this was a good gift for him! After a few washes the string on the outside comes out but it was washed frequently in a short time so maybe thats why! If your buying for someone who cant use toys its a good buy if they can play with toys I recommend you spent the money on the toys better because the quality isn't the greatest!
