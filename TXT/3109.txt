I love this bag it is really cute, i dont really like the orange inside but i knew that is how it came and that is my personal opinion. I gave it 4 stars because i wish it came with more pockets. It has no pockets on the outside and the ones on the inside are really tiny. I ended up using this bag as my new diaper bag lol!
