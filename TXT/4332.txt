This has got to be one of the most interesting games I've ever played for Sega. Not only did I never hear of it before I watched Angry Video Game Nerd in 2013, but surprisingly, Game Nerd was incorrect when he said this game was not fun to play. Watching stock footage does get a tad bit annoying, but you have to consider this is where all the new games got their ideas from. It's the equivalent to watching a story line for Resident Evil or Final Fantasy.  What's more interesting is how they did it because this was in the year 1993, before the technology was even close to what we have now.  You wouldn't believe how fun it is to watch these ugly zombies creep, run, jump, and fly towards you while you're desperatey trying to switch your ammo to kill shaman and restore your old soldier friends back to normal.  The movie is a lot of fun to watch on this with great one liners and a fake Jamaican and cheesy dumb blonde as a news reporter.  The fact is this game plays like a new video game. The only downside is you'll have to blow and clean your 32 x for what felt like a month before the thing would work. I think this is because they 32 x was so underplayed that it just doesn't want to work right away..poor guy.
