My husband was leaking after his surgery so I purchased a pair of these to see if they work. They are brilliant. He loves them. They have returned his dignity. As far as I'm concerned all men should consider these after prostate surgery. Can't recommend highly enough. It appears they are designed in Australia and I've purchased other Australian products over the years and never had an issue. Wish I could live there :)
