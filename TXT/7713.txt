This is one of the few albums where the musicians have actually gotten better rather than just trying something new. I was nervous of what Chris Adler would bring to their sound but if he has done anything, he has brought a solid foundation to their sound. It is somewhat overpowering at first compared to earlier albums but after the first few songs, it melds so damn well with the band. I love the direction they went while still doing the shoutouts to the styles from Kezia and Fortress. They kept their progressive sound and overall style while still doing something removed from what they have done before.My best friend put it best:When I look at bands today, I ask why, with all of the influence that they have, do they choose to sound like they do? This is the first band I have heard in years that has taken influence and created something new, imaginative, and so God damn good.If you have a mind for musical experimentation, an appreciation for raw talent, and a need for a new direction in progressive metal, buy this album twice.
