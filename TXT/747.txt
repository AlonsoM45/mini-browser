I want to like it so much, but I just can't do it. It is way too bulky. It is 6 1/4 inches wide and 8 3/4 inches long, in my opinion that is just way too bulky. I really need it so I am going to keep it, since I always get yelled at that there is no toilet paper. I will update in a few months if it rusts or anything changes.
