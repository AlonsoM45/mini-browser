I bought a Kindle Fire 3 months ago, and the fingertip method of typing and scrolling was okay, but fingernails got to be a problem.  Thought I'd have a bit more control with a stylus, and this one caught my eye.  Works perfectly and I'm glad to have a way to attach it to the Kindle itself.  I'm happy with my purchase!
