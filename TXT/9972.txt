I would really give this 4 1/2 stars. They were shipped fast and a lot cheaper than others I saw online. The only negative thing I could say is that they were just a little thinner than I had hoped. I have mailed several things so far, and have had no problems, but I worry about something poking and ripping them open. I may just be out of line for worrying about that, because I have really had no problems.
