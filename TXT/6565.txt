I got this in the mail in 3 days and hate it. It won't let me play any games on ps2 even if i download it onto my ps3 and its a wired joystick. The picture is of a wireless joystick not wired. If i had know it was a wired joystick i wouldn't have bought it. It also feels like really cheap plastic. But otherwise on the actually performance on ps3 games its ok, no dual-shock though which sucks. But for the price it was at i will give you 3 stars
