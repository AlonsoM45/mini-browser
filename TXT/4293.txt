I have taken this product a couple of times since I had the product. And to me it works slow I'm going to assume.  I haven't seen any results since taken it. I do say you get alot of product for your money which is a plus. However I dont want to compromise the quality or quanity. So i went with something stronger as well. Also I read an article about these types with Garcinia Cambogi a and it had Dr.Oz talking about the products saying he stand it and it works. However the Senate or who ever she was said other wise. Meaning  the product doesn't work.  Wish I had the link to it.  I'm sure I'm going to be returning it soon because I need something that shows me results at about the 2 week time frame.  And I know I put in the work ..5xs a week ..2xs a day  and yes I eat right majority of the time.  It's too hot to eat heavy foods.  I hope this helps.  I say Trial and Error.
