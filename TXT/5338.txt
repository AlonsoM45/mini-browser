I agree with all of the other 5 star reviews!  I did think that this would replace my need for a moisturizer.  However, it wasn't enough on its own.  I still use a daily moisturizer before I use Miracle skin.  I've used clinique, mac, bare essentials, cover girl, etc.  This is by far my favorite that I have used.  It is a light coverage and the reviews were correct you need to go a shade darker than you normally would.
