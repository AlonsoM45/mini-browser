I bought the tortoise gt sunglasses and after having them for a few weeks, I am very disappointed. At opening, I was very excited because they looked great and the metal piece holding the lenses seemed reliable. I noticed some lines across some parts of the plastic frame, but I didn't think much about them. In less than two weeks, one of the legs of the frame broke off! I didn't even apply much pressure. I placed it on top of my head, and while I lifted it off, it just fell apart. I wanted these to be sunglasses I didn't have to be worried about breaking but something that could hold up during the summer. These weren't it.
