I think it has very valuable contents, very useful for medicine students who want to learn antimicrobials.I don't like the one page format, because if you want to study a table, you need to see the left column and the upper crow of the table. With the actual format you can't see both, because the tables are divided in two parts. Also you can't read it in a iphone, if you want to see it in the hospital, for example.
