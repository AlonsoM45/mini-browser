The rotors are even and balanced well.  They perform well and so far I have no issues with these.  I know people spend a lot of money for brake rotors if you're going to spend money on your brake system, spend it on some high quality brake pads.  These rotors get the job done and they don't need all the fancy bells and whistle to do it.  The price is great and really hard to beat.  They came packaged as they should, in a box and wrapped in plastic.  When they leave the factory, they put an anti-rust treatment on the rotors so it's recommended you clean that off before installation with some brake cleaning fluid.  I installed them and my brakes have been much improved.  I would recommend these to anyone who needs new brake rotors.
