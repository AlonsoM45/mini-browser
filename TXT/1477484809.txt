I have to say that not only is this book amazing but also it answers everything I could have ever asked. I have read both of this authors books and they are just perfect! I love this book and I refer back to it very often. I find it hard to get help in the area I live as I work so much and theres not anywhere to go to be taught. This book has already taught me a great deal. It not only covers how to throw but also the position you should be in and common errors. I am also going back to the author's website (pottery-on-the-wheel.com) and reading the blogs posted there as well as they can be very informational and helpfull too. I cannot wait for this author to produce a third book.SincerelyKatrina from Florida
