I am 12 years old and my friend and team mate has the bat and one day he hit the ball really good and it hit the top of the fence but it was not a homer but it was close and today he did the same type of hit and it bounced of the guys mitt and rolled under the fence and the person who played outfield did not put his hand in the air so he ran all the way in and it was a run.But if you would like to know the details it has grate grip it looks super good it is legal for all tournaments and it is all composite it's one of the best bats I know and a another good bat is the Easton that is black and yellow don't know the name but it's in my wish list if u are interested in it
