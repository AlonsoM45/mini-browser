I would advise looking elsewhere for a case for your nexus 5. This Spigen slim case only protects the sides of the device, leaving the top and bottom edges unprotected. Because of the nexus 5's curved top and bottom edges, the phone is left extremely susceptible to taking fall damage in those areas. Otherwise, the case feels nice, though looks somewhat unfinished with exposed button cutouts.Advice to Spigen: Offer a slim version of this case with the top and bottom edges covered.
