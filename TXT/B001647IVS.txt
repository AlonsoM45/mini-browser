These lights did the job but were not &#34;Neon&#34; as described. I bought them for an outdoor 80's party and they looked more Christmasy than anything. Not very bright but again, did the job. Not the usual size as &#34;rope lights&#34; a little thinner. I did like how they connect so theres no break in lighting but I did have to call the company to figure out how to connect them because there are instructions for everything else about the lights EXCEPT how to connect them.
