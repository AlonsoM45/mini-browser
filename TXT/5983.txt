First of all: I'm not a professional photographer but rather the average "snapshot-guy" who travels around and likes to take some picture here and then. And because of that I wanted to go just a little further than the normal iphone camera.I bought this set for $20 (super saver shipping arrived in 5 days!) and I totally love it.The lenses appear to have a good quality (no flaws,...) and the set up was fairly easy.At first I thought the macro was broken but then I found out that you have to get REALLY REALLY close to the object and then you get awesome sharp shots!the fish eye is awesome and I dont know if its really 180 degrees, but it must be pretty close. Wide Angle is fun and is great for pictures of rooms and stuff because it covers way more than the usual iphone camera. I recommend using the 8x zoom with the tripod and you get awesome pictures, but even without it you can get good shots!Also, the case fits my iphone perfectly!long story short: I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! it was so cheap but still very good!everyone who wants to go a little further than the usual iphone camera should definitely buy this! It's a lot of fun!
