I had actually bought this for my father since he likes to cook jams and jellies. I was a little worried it would be poor quality like his last pot (he bought it at kohls or some place like that), but it was actually perfect! I think it has been 2 years now and besides a few little scratches here and there, it is still has very good structural integrity. Great quality!
