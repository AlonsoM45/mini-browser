Be VERY careful when buying this product. Please read the rest of my view if you&#8217;re considering of switching to a 4.A little about myself to understand clearly:I've been playing since 5th grade. Ive been section leader and 1st chair for 2 years. Currently a senior in high school.Review:These reeds are EXTREMELY hard to play at first. After my first practice, I was physically exhausted from trying to play. At the time, I could not even play a low D. Gradually I have been adapting to the reeds but they take A LOT of air.Pro:They play a lot louder. (It's probably because it's forcing you to push more air than usual, but still)Articulation is easierDynamics are easierCons:Physically exhausting the first couple of timesRequires a lot more air (This is actually a pro)Very hard to play lower notes (Still working on anything below a low C)A little more difficult to play quieter (Not very noticeable)Conclusion:Don't buy these reeds. If you&#8217;re still in high school, buy a 3 or maybe a 3.5 if you&#8217;re really wanting to switch. I love Vandoren but #4 reeds are a little overkill.
