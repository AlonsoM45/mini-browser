The seller is in China, so it took 3 weeks to get to me.  They had it packaged in extreme bubble-wrap.  There was no way the screen was going to get damaged in shipping.  The price was a little more than I had hoped for but it was much cheaper than purchasing a new ipod.  Changing the screen was quite easy.  Took me less than 3 minutes to do.  There are youtube videos that should exactly how to do it.
