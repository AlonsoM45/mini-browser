This Bowie Knife is made using quality materials, and is certainly worth the price the seller is asking, but I can only give it a 3 star rating because the craftsmanship is lacking in the final knife product, it's a shame because this could be a very fine knife, one which would give any purchaser pride in owing it, but again what it offers in quality materials it lacks in craftsmanship.  I would have been happy to pay more if the the quality of the craftsmanship was better, but at it's current price it's still a good buy.
