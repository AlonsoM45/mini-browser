I am very happy with this product. The spring-loaded buttons on the side fits very snugly into the lighter socket. It charges my iPhone 5 at a high speed and stayed charging throughout, it never once fell out of the hole. It also has a very elegant, simple design. Once it is plugged in, a blue glow will indicate that it is ready to be used with adds an awesome effect especially when driving in the night. Another plus was that this product was also delivered very promptly as I received mine within a few days of purchasing it. All in all, this product is very sturdy and is certainly NOT a low quality charger. Im truly impressed with this product and it is definitely worth paying the price for its high quality.
