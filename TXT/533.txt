I never been so moved before, the more I read books from Konstantinos, the more developed my magical abilities become... Yes I know you cannot read a book and turn into Aliester Crowley over night, but by performing the rites and techniques you literally see and feel progress, these rites worked for me, and if it worked for me it will for those of you who desire magical development. I was a beginner before I read his previous book Nocturnal Witchcraft, I was also more interested in the left hand path, but once I read the book before I was even halfway done, I was already reaching spiritual and magical goals that I have been waiting years for... I'm am now a dedicated nocturnal witch training for my initiation (a year and a day) and this book gets more and more intense as well as my spiritual, and magical growth... Do not listen to any one who bad mouths this book or author, magic isn't for everyone, and people who have been in the occult for a while might be use to a different tradition, and might not be ready for nocturnal witchcraft... it is true, this book is a powerful book, and  will bring any beginner seeking more power up a notch... Take my word for it...
