If you liked the Halo series you're probably gonna like this one too. Personally, I didn't like the changes to the multiplayer. It's something new, which is good to have... but I think they should go back to the old Halo play style for future releases, because we all know Halo 4 isn't the last Halo. Microsoft wouldn't let that happen.
