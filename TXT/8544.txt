I absolutely love this agenda. It is super pretty and it has plenty of space to write. It is a perfect size, not too big not too small, and I love how the front and back flaps have a fold which allows you to store/bookmark pages.I didn't give it 5 stars because it would be better if it had a full month view at the beginning of each month and the material of which its made of can cause the ink to smear depending on what type of pen you use.
