Absolutely Love this Oil. Great on my dry hands, elbows, and more, after the Harsh winter we have had, in NY state. Great for working out those tired muscles you have after a hard days work, or shoveling or yard work too. Nice for using as a massage aid too. Wonderful scent, Highly recommend this product.
