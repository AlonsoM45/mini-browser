Norton 360 becomes inactive when the computer is put into standby.  I have to restart the computer many times each day to reactivate.  Spent approximately 6 hours on the telepnone with Norton support trying  to correct the problem.  However, support was never able to come up with a solution.  According the the Norton forums, many people are having similar problems with Norton 360.
