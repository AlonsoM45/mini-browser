So in the picture i saw a nice size detailed metal puzzle. Eager to try since I enjoy 3d wood puzzles, i ordered it. Well to my disappointment I got in the mail a small square about 4 inches around. And to add more disappointment when I built it it was smaller than the palm of my hand. For the price it should of been much much larger. Don't be fooled. It's only worth $5.00.Update 4/15/2013I have bought and completed 13 of these MODELS from A.C. Moore for $5.99 a piece, so i stand by my comment that thiss one is overpriced. It was still fun to build just like all the others from the maker of this brand.Just be warned, They are small.
