I ordered this for somebody as a Christmas present... needless to say they cried from happiness when they opened it. I am not a Dr. Who fan myself but she is an avid fan, so even though she doesn't play guitar she still loved the present. Also the gift came almost 2 weeks earlier than it said that it would which was nice because it was here for our Christmas exchange!
