Oakleys are also well known name but honestly I was kind of disappointed with the quality of the frames the definitely feel like they could break easily if your not careful. It's the lens you pay for without a doubt but they could've made the frames feel a little less plasticy and cheap feel. But there Oakleys its the name your buying an expensive name at that
