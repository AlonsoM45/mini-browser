I got this for a cheap and easy way to heat up water while camping with my kids. I didnt put much faith in it because of the price. It did take quite a while to ship but at this price you can not beat it. I have not used it very hard yet, thats why i am giving it 4 stars, will update it after some serious use. Case is flimsy, but what can you expect?
