I used to use cheap razors with only one or two blades and they done alright but I'd have to go over them more than once which always results in razor burn.This razor cartridge is great has five small blades which means gets more hair and causes a smooth shave. I've not once broke out since using this and I honestly don't think i'd ever go back.I was lucky enough to try this for free thanks to a program from Gillette.
