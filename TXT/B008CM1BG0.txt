This is a good beanie, but it has a few things that could be better. The shape of the beanie is a little cone-ish. It could also be a little thicker to protect from wind and cold. Other than that, the fabric is nice feeling and well stitched, no loose threads so far. It is also very comfortable once you get it situated, and also stays in place alot better than most beanies if you have long hair.
