I love these furniture legs. I ordered the 7&#34; legs twice and the 8&#34; once. I bought this set for a new couch I bought for my father (elderly gentlemen with knee problems) I gave him my 8&#34; legs instead. He did not get a chance to enjoy the furniture legs, but my second mom now has the furniture in her house and she loves the extra height from the furniture legs. She's an overweight senior citizen with health and joint problems. It is much easier for her now to sit down and stand up from the furniture.  I have the furniture legs on my sofa in the living room and den as well as on the love set in my living room. All of my friends and family love the extra height of my furniture. (Of course, they're all big, tall or both usually both.). The only problem with the legs is to make sure the current furniture has the opening to screw the the legs in.
