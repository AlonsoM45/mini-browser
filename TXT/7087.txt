I needed a bike mount for my phone for when I go to unfamiliar places. I saw this and it looked like what I was looking for. It wasn't too expensive either. It was shipped quickly and installation was easy. It easily held my GS4 in all types of cases. I used it for directions so that I don't need to hold my phone or have earphones in to see directions. The only problem is that the phone shook a lot no matter how tight I had the mount. This shaking caused the phone's position to shift constantly. I used it quite frequently. About 4-5 times per week for 1 hour each time. I was riding around, and I hear a slight crack as I'm riding on a slightly bumpy sidewalk. Then I hit a minor bump (barely 1 inch) and the phone-holding part completely separated from the mount. I did have a very protective case on my phone, but if I didn't, my phone would have been destroyed. Honestly I only recommend this product if you are only staying on paved streets.
