I am very happy with this Ahnu boot.  The comfort, great style and color is exactly what I was looking for.  After reading several of the reviews, I decided to go 1/2 size larger, but it actually is just a little large for me.  I normally wear a size 7.  It's not a big problem since I only wear these in the winter months, and adding a second pair of thin socks with my wool socks makes it fit perfectly.  I became familiar with the brand from a pair of very similar boots that I ordered for my husband.  I am not disappointed, and would happily buy this brand again.  Great boot for the money.
