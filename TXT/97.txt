Not wanting to run wires out to the patio I thought I would give these a try.  After getting them delivered and seeing how small and lightweight they are, I was skeptical.  After hooking them up, I was surprised by how good the sound quality was.  They are very easy to install.  I used a 3.5mm Stereo Female to RCA Male Y-Cable to attach the transmitter to an audio out plug on my AV Reciever.  This way I can play CDs or listen to the music channels from Cable TV.  I have them plugged into wall sockets, instead of using batteries, since other reviews said the sound quality isn't as good with the batteries (although I never did try batteries).  I bought a second pair of speakers (comes with a free transmitter) to use on another section of the patio, still using just the one transmitter.  Very easy to set up.
