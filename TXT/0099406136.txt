I truly love John Grisham's novels and would have given Summons a 4 up until the ending. I turned the page ready to continue and realized that the previous page was the end of the book. I chose the book because it had some of the same cast of characters and setting as A Time To Kill, Sycamore Row and The Last Juror, which were excellent. This book just didn't cut it.
