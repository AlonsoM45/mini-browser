I researched 10+ different iphone battery cases and this ex-era is the best no doubt. All the other similar items on ebay have lower grade cells that compose the battery pack. Lower grade as in not having the actual amperage that they say they have in them and being a low quality impure lithium product that results in much lower performance and lifespan.Also the circuitry that is built in this ex-era case is much more superior. Which ensures proper charging and discharging.This case beats the mophie (80.00 at best buy)because ex-era system comes with a dual charger, and 2 battery pack, basically triple your iphone battery life. No battery case can beat it.
