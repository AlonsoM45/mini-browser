Mine came in with scratched glass in 2 places and although the photo shows finished wood on the inner part of the top in the photo, mine was not and I was informed none come finished. Either this is false information or false advertising - either way, I am in the process of returning this item and as my title says - never again. And, it's cheaper at Target.
