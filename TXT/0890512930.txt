Dr. Morris combines his extensive knowledge of creation, where he is the father of modern creationism, together with his extensive years of Bible study and training to provide a unique resource for those approaching creation from a Biblical perspective.  I recommend this book highly for what it is designed to do - to show what the Bible says about various topics related to creation, and especially the debate with the evolutionary worldview.
