I love this style, but ended up having to return it because the hole in the middle was very tiny. I wear size 0g, but it still was not as big as the holes usually are. I just didn't like the look of the hole. I recommend buying this one when your gauges are a little bigger than just 0g; it makes your plugs look tiny.
