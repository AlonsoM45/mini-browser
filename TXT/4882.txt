My incredible 4g LTE phone was not charging for some reason so I bought this so I could just change out the batteries when it got low. after about 3 months one of these generic batteries stopped holding a charge, but between the battery that came with my phone and the extra one I have from this it is fine. I have had it for just short of a year now, and it still works as good as it did the day I got it.
