I was with the 19th TASS Chu Lai and few 16 hours under TIC conditions. At first I thought it was cool but then I saw the ground fire, which changed my attitude. The FAC were a different breed and deserve all the respect. They flew the slow birds and were in constant danger as they were easy targets.I was a Radio Operator call sign Helix Control 66-67.
