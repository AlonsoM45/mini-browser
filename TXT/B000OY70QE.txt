I love haba but for the price , not sure that the expected quality is there --- the stroller is great but the pillow/blanket / mattress are pretty cheap and lumpy. Tags say 'designed and quality of haba Germany' but do not explicitly state made in Germany.... Which leaves me thinking the fabric parts of this item were made at least in part in china , which is what I've been striving to avoid. The whole thing is supposed to be made in Germany but I've got my doubts about the fabric !  That being said, my daughter loves loves loves this stroller ! She uses it all of the time to help with walking. It's  very solid and durable , and came requiring minimal assembly.  It's really an adorable item and the stroller itself is heirloom quality. The stroller itself should get 5 stars but the cheap fabric knocks it down to a 4 star.
