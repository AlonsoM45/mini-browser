The first time I started reading this book, life interrupted. When I finally got back to it I had to restart it. It is a good book. One the will make it into my favorites. I appreciate that Jolie isn't led by her hormones as so many women in books are these days. She is also strong, but still needs her friends to center her without using them as a crutch.
