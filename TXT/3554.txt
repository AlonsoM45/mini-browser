I have a Nexus 5 and a Bose Sound Dock Series II. I plug it in, attach the USB and the audio plug to the phone, and it works.  Now I can charge my phone while I listen using the Bose.  I was afraid when I replaced my old iPhone that I would no longer be able to use it.  Thanks to the dockBoss5, I can.  The only thing is I have not tested it with my vehicle and will update once I do.  Also, it is kinda a pain to have wires sticking out of the top and bottom of the phone but without replacing the Bose, this is the BEST option.
