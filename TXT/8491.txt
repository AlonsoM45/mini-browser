It's sick.It's creepy.It's disgusting.It's unethical.It's psycho.It's mentally ill.It's pervert.All of these epithets might suit to describe this book. I think some people might not even read it fully.The author, Chuck Palahniuk, can really write intriguing and creepy plots for the stories. I'm not too much into novel, but as I liked "Fight Club", written by the same author, I decided to read this book as well. I can say, Chuck really surprised me with this book. I didn't expect it to be so sick. Of course it depends on the attitude, of how sick you see it, but even for me thinking to have a wide attitude, the story was pervert. And I don't mean pervert in a sexual way, I mean pervert in mind way.The story basically concentrates on few young people having everything in their lives. What I liked the most, that the author shows what is happening in their heads, but this is fully revealed only in the end of the book. One of the main quotes of the book is: "Everything we want is what we are trained to want". And only reading this book fully you can see to what sick thoughts, actions and consequences it could a damaged mind bring to.If you think you can imagine all freaky-pervert show, you should really read this one!
