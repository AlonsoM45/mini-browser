I read the book in a day. It was very infromative. It tells you why you should start the cleanse and what steps you need to take to be successful during the cleanse. It also breaks down how you may feel physically. This was very helpful for me. When I went through some of the withdrawal symptoms I knew how to cope with them and to keep pushing through the cleanse. I lost 10lbs during the cleanse. I also lost inches. I'm thankful for being able to break my sugar addiction and start a new healthy lifestyle. Great Job JJ Smith!
