Launching a leadership revolution is one of the books I just finished reading this month. I have to admit I really needed it and I believe everyone who is leading somebody or wants to lead must read this great book.Two amazing authors Chris Brady and Orrin Woodward gives us an incredible opportunity to learn from their experience on leadership. One of them, Chris Brady, I met in live event about a year ago. I can say that this man is an amazing speaker, who made a big impact on me. So getting to read the book he co-authors was a great opportunity for me to deepen my knowledge in leadership mastery.I like it very much that everything is very clear. All leadership mastery is distinguished in smaller parts and it's very easy to determine which part you are in. Knowing this it is very easy to understand where you need to improve and what is the next step. Authors call this the five levels of influence and they gives you step-by-step instructions what you need in everyone of them, so it's very easy to see where exactly you need to improve and what exactly you need to do to master every level. Examples of the real people in every level of influence made this book really attractive for me.Launching a leadership revolution really helped me to understand which areas I need to improve and gave me the guidance what exactly should I do. That's why I think that it is really great book for everyone who wants to master the art of leadership. I think this book will help everyone despite of which level of leadership you are in, because a real leader always has where to improve.
