Case arrived damaged.  Pieces of the red paint were chipped and very noticeable BEFORE removing the plastic.  The screen protector was nothing to write home about, and I never planned on using the stylus.  Returned the next day and received a full refund.  My disappointment was short-lived as I also ordered the SPIGEN Neo Hybrid case in red alongside this case.
