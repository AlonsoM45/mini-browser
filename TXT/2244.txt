I have been interested in this case since I saw it covered on 48 Hours a few years ago. I definately have been a believe in their innocence, and was elated when the WM3 were release. I found Damien's story interesting and compelling. I enjoyed the inside look into his life and thoughts. His spirit amazes me.
