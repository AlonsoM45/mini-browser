This is the BEST product I have ever purchased.The potty training process can be such a nightmare but I committed to stop using diapers at night and my daughter was dry after only 2 nights using the Conni pad.I'm absolutely delighted. Every mom with a toddler who needs night time training should get one. I imagine they would be perfect for bedwetters also. It is very absorbent yet feels dry.
