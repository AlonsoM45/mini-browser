As a teacher, it's always shocking how little resources exist for teaching about the colonies. However, this book does an excellent job of showing how delicate the relationship was between the Natives and the Americans. It also clearly illustrates the struggles early settlements like Jamestown had in dealing with hunger, disease, and the threat of attack. It's not overly graphic, but death plays a major role throughout the book.
