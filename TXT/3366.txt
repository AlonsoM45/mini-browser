First off, I am a 20 year old male. This product is simply amazing. I have had it about a week, and used it every day so far. I bought this item in hope to clear up my acne/acne scars. I had little hope when purchasing this item due to the fact that I have tried so many different things to clear up my face. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING comes close to this. Like I said, I use it once a day mixing with water, and leave it on roughly 15 minutes. Your face feels so refreshed after you are done. I noticed results in just a couple days of use. Ladies, and gentlemen there is obviously no &#34;miracle&#34; product out there that will just clear up your acne instantly, but this is about as close as it comes. Well worth the money, and honestly I think it's a steal. I would of payed far more money if I knew how well this product worked. I even let my sister, and mom try it, and they too liked it a lot. So before you go waste your money on stuff like nuetrogena, or clearasil; try this Aztec stuff out. Trust me, it will give you much better results, won't irritate your skin, and it's also healthy for your skin unlike most other face products. Anyways, I am very pleased.
