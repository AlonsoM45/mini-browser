I got this tent for my birthday and first set it up in the backyard one rainy spring weekend to test its water resistance.  It was a little damp and the wind collapsed it, but my yard is wide open and full of sand/gravel on that side.  I bought some more yellow stakes and we didn't blow away at all this weekend.  The tent also stayed dry under the cover of the trees which was great.  We love that we can fit our queen-size air mattress and 2 sleeping bags for the kids in the back room with plenty of room for storage and moving about.  The &#34;windows&#34; in the front screen room close up to keep the elements out which came in handy during the rain - especially with two young kids and a dog.  I put it together myself in less than twenty minutes and I'm only 5' 4&#34; tall.  I would definitely recommend it for families and people that camp for long amounts of time.  Our next camping trip will be for 7+ days and we can't wait.
