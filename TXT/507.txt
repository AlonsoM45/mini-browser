I hesitated before purchasing it as I thought it was a bit pricey-especially because I have other low black boots, but the style is very classic and you can't go wrong with it. You do have to be careful when wearing these, because the leather is nice but somewhat delicate. I scuffed the pointed toes the first time wearing them - was very upset, but was able to work on the pulled leather and make it look a little less noticeable.  It is a comfortable boot, and hard to find. But if you treat it with care, you will get a lot of enjoyment from it.
