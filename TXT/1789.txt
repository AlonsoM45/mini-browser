I am an avid maker of rubber band figures and bracelets, etc.  I came across these Rainbow Braid bands and decided to give them a try.  So many bands made by other companies did not hold up to the rigors of looming them, let alone keep from breaking or lasting very long once made.  All I can say is the Rainbow Braid bands are awesome.  I made several action figures for the neighbor children and the bands held up to all the stretching and pulling making action figures require.  I would definitely buy these again and I recommend them to everyone.  Thanks Rainbow Braids for making an awesome product.
