I bought the coral color in both small and x-small for my upcoming vacation to Mexico to help block sun exposure. It's absolutely perfect for this purpose. The color is really nice and pretty. However, when ordering keep in mind that it runs very big. I sent back the small and kept the x-small. I usually wear a S/M in ladies clothes and a M/L in juniors sized clothing.
