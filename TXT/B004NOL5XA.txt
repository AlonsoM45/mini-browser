This by far is the best vacuum I have EVER owned! Maybe just because I have had crap upright vacuums my whole adult life but I went with the canister because I have been let down by uprights that claim they do floors when they dont. My mom and friend both have Electrolux's that havent failed them so I decided to go with it. I could have spent $30 less on a Dyson upright that claims it does floors but I wasnt going to be fooled again! This vacuum is so quiet. Now I can vacuum when the kids are outside or in the bathtub because I can still hear them! It picks up the dog hair the first time and I havent had to sweep since I got it! Yes, it's amazing!
