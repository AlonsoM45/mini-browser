i really love this cookbook. It was very helpful for me. It not only taught me how to make many yummy snacks, it also taught  me how to do the paleo diet the right way. I also loved how easy this was. I have a really busy hectic life, so i loved how fast these recipes were. It didn't take anytime at all to make these snacks. It also has great kid snacks, that my younger cousins loved. i'll defiantly be looking out for more cookbooks from them.
