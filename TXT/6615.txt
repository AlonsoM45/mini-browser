The Nerf Triple Armor lives up to it's name. I gave it 5 stars because it is just like a suit of armour for your DS. My daughter has dropped hers several times with no damage. This is the second case and second DS we have bought her. The first one broke (both the case and the DS) that we have bought her. It is a little more bulky than a normal case but cushions the DS well. It was easy to install and works for several different models. In closing this case is an excellent investment towards keeping your DS safe from damage caused by a drop, and I would recommend it for everyone.
