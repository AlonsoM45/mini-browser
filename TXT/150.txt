So I recieved the batman trilogy on blu-ray and I went to play the batman begins disc and it would not play. I tried it in a blu-ray player and my ps3 with firmware updates and got nothing. Not only does it not play but it shuts off and freezes the entire blu ray player, and on the ps3 you get to the home screen and there is no play button. Soooo disappointing !!!! even though I'm in the minority with this opinion I like batman begins as much as dark knight rises. So I say to what ever company is pumping these out without quality control, PLEASE STOP!!! it is not just me this has happened to 2 other people I know.
