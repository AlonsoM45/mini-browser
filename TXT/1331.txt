This amp is amazing and for that price, it just doesn't seem right.  But it is and the amp is great.  I'm pairing the amp with an Alpine 1043d sub and this thing makes the sub sound incredible.  I don't even have the gain turned up on the amp, I'm just using the EQ settings on my head unit and it sounds amazing.  If I wanted to, I could turn up the gain and rattle some windows, I'm more concerned about quality bass sound and this amp gives me that.  I've yet to have any issues with the amp as it doesn't get too hot even after pushing it.  This thing can handle it.  Highly recommended to anyone looking for an amp.
