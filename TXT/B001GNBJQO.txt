The right arm broke off within 20 minutes of having them.  I was not rough with them and they were not dropped.  The arm just.... Literally fell off.  So frustrating to pay over 100 dollars for these cheap china-made pieces of crap, wait for so long to get them, then they fall apart within 20 minutes when I'm going on vacation the next day.  Might as well get a five dollar pair from the gas station, they last longer.  I'd give it zero stars if I could.
