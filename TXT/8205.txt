Based off of Benchmade design, this is a good knife for the money. A wee bit of play in the blade when locked, but still worth the money. May need to be run through the sharpener and a good stropping when you get it, but that is expected from a &#34;knock-off&#34; knife. Bee is not a cheap brand though, so don't be afraid to purchase. Worth the money.
