I wear size 15 wide shoes normally, but they only had these in 15 at the time. I needed new running shoes so I ordered them anyways. They were only $38 and they arrived at my house in only three days. They were snug at first, but most new shoes are, they fit fine now and are comfortable to run, walk, and lift in. They look good too. Highly recommend them, I will most likely buy another pair when I need to in the future.
