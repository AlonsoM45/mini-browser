Jim Carrey is really a great actor. I personally admire him more in comedies, but this movie proved that he could play any role in acting. I saw The Number 23 couple of times. It made me a big impression then I saw this film the first time, because I didn't know anything what was going to happen and the most interesting thing is that the movie kept the tension all the time till the end. Even in the end of the movie, when everything became more clear, there raised a new question - &#34;why&#34;, which kept the tension even more longer.The idea of this movie is mystical. The name of the film tells us a small hint - number 23. Everything what happens in this movie is connected to this number and the main character (Jim Carrey) gets obsessed with this thing. His obsession evolves to actions what finally ends in a very unexpected way.I was trying to look at this situation logically. From the experience I've got and the books I've read I know that everything is possible to explain in reasonable way. One of the facts is that we see what we want to see and where we concentrate our attention. Moreover, it depends on what is usually going on in our heads. After watching this movie, couple next days I saw number 23 couple of times. I payed attention to that, that's why I saw it. I didn't count the times I saw other numbers those days and that doesn't mean that number 23 was following me.Wish you a great watching! If you like mystics, this movie is exactly for you!
