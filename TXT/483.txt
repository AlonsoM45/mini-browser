This book earned five stars because it covered everything. It was exciting, sad, and kept you wondering what Janie would do next. This book goes inside what it is like to be thoroughly alone, an undercover cop in a high school setting, it shows the dangers if date-rape drugs, and what it is like to lose you mentor. I recommend this book to ANYONE THAT CAN READ !
