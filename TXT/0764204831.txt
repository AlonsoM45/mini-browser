I always enjoy the historical fiction that Tracie Peterson writes. I find them all enlightening from the historical standpoint. I remember studying the Industrial revolution in High School but this book brought it to life for me. Most of all the way they have weaved (pun intended)  God's redeeming love and grace is amazing. I find myself striving to be more like the heroines of her stories.
