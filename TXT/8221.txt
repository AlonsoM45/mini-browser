i rili shuld give this watch 5stars, judging from the package it came in, quality and condition. got it for my sis and i didnt even av d wrist problem seen in most reviews. but the watch seems to work only wen its being worn(meanin u av to set the watch errfin u take it off) Also, the indiglo light seems to dim after being used a couple of times. Other than this, 9ce watch
