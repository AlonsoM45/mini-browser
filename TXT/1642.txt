Lights up the room with crazy colours. I bought it as a night light for my daughter. Has 8 different lighting options which is cool. But the lights change really fast which is kind of defeating the purpose of a night light. I thought the colour would change slower to be more soothing so it could help her fall asleep not be like a night club with flashing lights. It is very bright. Doesn't matter though she loves it and thinks its pretty. Its just a plus for me because saves me on hydro so she doesn't have her lamps on all night. It also come with batteries. Delivery arrived on time as well.
