This movie has Scorsese's name associated with it? Did he think that EDITING might be in order? Marty, please! 3 hrs of the same sequences in different settings: car, bedroom, plane, etc. Note quite as boring and mindless as &#34;Gravity,&#34; and certainly better acting, but I did walk away mid way through. I felt like they were trying to do an ill -  conceived remake of Decaprio's role in &#34;Catch Me if You Can.&#34; Here his character was drug-addeled and shallow.
