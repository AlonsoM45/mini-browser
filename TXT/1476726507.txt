I have always loved Tim Conway!!!! Some of my favorite childhood memories are of sitting in the living room,with my grandparents, on Saturday nights, waiting to see what he, and Harvey Korman would do on the Carol Burnett show that week. Even as a little girl, I thought Tim Conway was hysterical!!!! Still do!!!! Whether I'm watching an interview with him, watching the DVDS of the Carol Burnett Show, or reading this book, he makes me laugh so hard, for days my stomach muscles feel like I've done a thousand sit-ups!!! I am glad I bought this book on my Kindle because now, I'll own it forever, and it won't fall apart when I've read it a thousand times!!! Highly recommend it!!!!!! Wish I could've given it 5,000 stars!!!!!!
