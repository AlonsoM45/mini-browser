I'm somewhat &#34;new&#34; to the Sci-Fi/ Fantasy style books, (not new to reading in general by any means), and I thought that the &#34;Song Of Ice And Fire&#34; series was as good a place as any to start out. I would definatley reccommend reading it, but it you're just starting Sci-Fi/Fantasy books like I was, you should start out with something a little bit more light. And I don't mean figuratively either. The book is LONG. Maybe not long as compared to other books of this genre, but long nontheless. If you do decide to read it, have the next book close in hand for when you finish ;)
