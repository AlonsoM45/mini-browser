Having payed only around $100 for this watch i was pretty pleased with what i received. The watch face is gorgeous; the color contrast is beautiful and the sub dials give the face an intricate look.  Also the size fits my wrist perfectly since i consider my forarm to be relatively big. My only dislikes are the fact that the thickness of the watch is actually it bit bigger than i imagined which makes it feel a bit bulkier than i prefer and that the buttons on the chronograph are a bit clunky (ie a bit too big and gets stuck sometimes). But all in all i'm satisfied with my purchase.
