WE HAVE HAD CORELLE DISHES IN THE PAST BUT WENT TO OTHER STYLES JUST FOR A CHANGE.  WE HAVE REMODELED THE KITCHEN AND BOUGHT NEW DISHES AND MY WIFE LIKED THE SQUARE AND THE LIGHTNESS OF CORELLE.  WE HAVE BEEN USING THEM AND JUST LOVE THEM.  THEY ARE VERY GOOD LOOKING, DURABLE AND JUST NICE TO EAT OFF OF.  THE MUGS HAVE A NICE HANDLE TO HOLD ONTO.  I WAS HESITANT TO BUY BUT THE WIFE WANTED THEM SO WE HAVE THEM.  ONCE I STARTED USING THEM I REALLY LOVE THEM.  THE SHIPMENT CAME ALL SECURE WITH NO PROBLEMS.
