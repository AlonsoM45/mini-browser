I thought this one was going to be just a flat documentary book, but after I started the first few chapters, I just kept going and going. The paragraphs are flowing attractively, and the more I read, the more I found the interesting knowledges and ideas within. This is a great true story, and also inspirational one I happened to stumble upon. There are not much sports writings that left me feeling good, energized, intrigued, and eager to try the techniques myself. This one does. I felt grateful and happy for McDougall to be willing to share this good writing.
