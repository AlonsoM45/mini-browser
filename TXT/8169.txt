this bookk is a wonderful idea. i bought it for my 4 year old and sat sown with him to create some of the most creative ideas they have in there. after i showed him how to build those projects he was able to repeat them on his own, and it kept him busy for really long. for example he built a 3 story house then put in animals on 1 floor, people on another and so on. he also built the table and chairs, and brought fake food for the people. in general i feel the book is so worth the small price it costs, it takes the amazing toy to greater options!!
