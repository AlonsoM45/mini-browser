This review contains a few spoilers for the first two books in the series, Cinder and Scarlet. If you have not read them yet&#8230; I suggest you do that now, because you&#8217;re missing out. There also may be a few minor ones for Cress.Oh my stars, this was awesome. This is by far the best book of the series so far, for me personally. I loved it so much! I read it the minute I got it in my mail and I finished it that same day. Could not put it down. Cress is a action-packed, brilliantly written, amazing, wild roller coaster ride. And as soon as all of it has processed in my mind and I have written this review, I will go and cry because I will have to wait for a whole year for Winter.Cress is the third book in the Lunar Chronicles. In it we first meet Cress. She is a very talented hacker and has lived in a satellite for years as a prisoner, working for the Lunar Queen. But she has other plans and calls for help from our beloved gang. Cinder, Thorne, Wolf and Scarlet go to her rescue, but stuff happens and they get separated from each other. Cress and Thorne are catapulted down to Earth in the satellite, Scarlet is taken by Cress&#8217;s mistress, Sibyl to Luna and Cinder and Wolf manage to escape in their ship to Africa where they meet with Dr. Erland. The clock is ticking and they have to find each other again and make a plan to stop Queen Levana.Yes, it is as awesome as it sounds. My heart was racing the entire time and I just had to keep on reading. While the other two books were a bit predictable, Cinder more than Scarlet, this one was not. Which had me sitting on the edge of my seat for all of the 550 pages. I think that&#8217;s why I loved this one the most so far. The writing is still incredible and really, I bow to you Marissa. I really do. There is not much of a recap, so if it has been a year since you&#8217;ve read the other books&#8230; shame on you! You could&#8217;ve done a marathon and then crawl to a corner and cry like the rest of us because of the long wait for Winter. Seriously though&#8230; A year? I don&#8217;t compute.So stuff happens when they rescue Cress and they are separated. Scarlet is taken to Luna as a prisoner and even though she didn&#8217;t have a lot of story in this book, it&#8217;s still really intense. Especially towards the end. My god, Marissa, you are merciless! Which brings me to Thorne and Cress. When they crash to Earth (of course they don&#8217;t die, the book would be over if they did, so it&#8217;s not a spoiler), something happens to Thorne which makes him blind. At first I was raging mad at Marissa for doing that, because well&#8230; we all love Thorne. But he still is the same arrogant handsome jerk we all hate because we love him, so it&#8217;s all good. They are stranded in the desert and I loved how they bonded. And Cress&#8217;s first moments on Earth were actually pretty funny, because it reminded me of Rapunzel in the Disney movie Tangled when she first came out of her tower. (Yes, the song would fit perfectly for that moment in the book too.) Overall, Cress was pretty similar to Rapunzel from Tangled, which I loved because I love that movie. You know, she&#8217;s a bit awkward around other people because she&#8217;s been alone for all those years except for a few visits from her mistress. She&#8217;s funny and yes I can picture her defending herself with a frying pan. But she&#8217;s also an amazing hacker and a really great character and I loved her.Then we come to Cinder and Wolf. Wolf also doesn&#8217;t have much of a story because he&#8217;s knocked out for one part of the book and practically a zombie the other part. He worries about Scarlet, which does give him some character development. Cinder has a lot of pressure on her shoulders and in this book, she&#8217;s really scared and worried. What if she can&#8217;t save the world? What if her plan goes horribly wrong? And I loved that too because it means that she&#8217;s no Mary Sue and it makes her more human too. But of course, she&#8217;s still a bad ass cyborg Lunar princess so she kicks ass when she has too.That leaves us with the other minor characters. There&#8217;s a new one (sort off), Jacin Clay. He&#8217;s a Lunar Guard who actually helped Cinder and Wolf escape from the satellite. He&#8217;s mentioned in the first book too if I remember correctly. Then we have Dr. Erland, also from book one. He&#8217;s in Africa, where Cinder meets up with him and he also has a storyline, which I&#8217;m not going to talk about because that&#8217;s a spoiler. So I&#8217;ll move on to Kai, who I love again! In Scarlet, I had a love-hate relationship with him, but not anymore. He&#8217;s a prince and he&#8217;s hot and he actually does things right in this book. Well, for the most part anyway. That leaves us with&#8230;. Levana. Yeah, still hate her. I&#8217;m not going to talk about all the other side characters, but I do want to mention one of them because she has a pretty big role in the fourth book! Yes, Winter makes an appearance towards the end. I won&#8217;t spoil anything about it, all I&#8217;ll say is that she&#8217;s not what I thought she would be, in a very good way. And it makes me even more excited to read the next book.Stars, it seems I have a lot to say about these books. They are just so brilliant and I love them so much and I try to avoid thinking about how long the wait is for Winter. But time goes by very quick for me these days, so 2015 will be here before I realize. At least, that&#8217;s what I hope. Of course I recommend this book! Fans of the series so far won&#8217;t be disappointed and if you are&#8230; I think you read another book. So if you haven&#8217;t had the chance to start this one yet, brace yourself because you&#8217;re in for a wild ride!
