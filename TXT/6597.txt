So ithought it was a awesome mouth wash until i just decided to look it up online an just happen to click on the reviews because it had such low reviews an I was like mmh that's weird, so I start reading the reviews an now it's too late my tongue kinda burns an ihave a metallic taste in my mouth awesome..my advice throw it out or get a refund. Idk what to say other than wow..
