I have only had mine a week but getting plenty of questions, and best of all is the price.A quality watch that also looks the part.  This gives some of my TAG's a run for their money in the show stakes.If your thinking of buying one you wont be disappointed.Oh, doing up the band is surely an IQ test, eventually I passed though.Cheers
