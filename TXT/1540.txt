Nice, doesn't run, very solid color when airbrushed.Fair warning goes on very vibrant and solid in color on buttercream and whipped icing but will fade significantly on whipped so spray it much heavier/darker than you are expecting the result to look like...I've never done it before but my wife with more than two decades experience doing cakes in bakeries walked me through it...our tie-dye cake started very, very dark and within an hour or so faded to a proper hippie tie-dye look.
