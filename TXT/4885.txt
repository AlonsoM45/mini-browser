I had orginally bought a very similair Gerry jacket at sports authority, but a week later the zipper broke off. I bought it knowing the zipper had problems, but I didn't think it was going to break like it did. So I returned it and bought this one on amazon. It is nearly identical to my orgibal one. It keeps me super warm and keeps the wind out. I also really like the fact you can zip the other jacket into the bigger jacket. The only down fall on this jacket is the Velcro straps on the sleeves. The Velcro works but they made the strap out of flexable plastic so if you made the sleeves as tight as you could you have like half of the strap hanging out.. but other than that it is great and I love it!!!
