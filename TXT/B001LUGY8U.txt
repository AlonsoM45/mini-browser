I bought this for my mother so she could take her cat outside for walks. It took a week or so and some bribery with treats inside it to get her Burmese in it. Now weather permitting they go for walks everyday. It is sturdy enough to lean on like a cart which helps my mother be able to walk longer distance. The quality of the stroller is everything the reviews I read described.
