I loved this book. After reading it I couldn't believe it was free. This book is very interactive. It gives you  a view from a telescope as well as a flashlight type effect so you can see in the dark surrounding main character. Also has a couple mini games. They  don't have to be played during the reading of the book but I can see that they appeal to kids. My 4 yr old granddaughter enjoyed this book.  As for myself I both enjoyed the story and the layout. Thank you for this great free book. I highly recommend.
