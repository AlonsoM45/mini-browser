Great set of crimper and dies for the price,  The case is convenient and stores the crimper and dies securely.  Comes with a wide variety of dies.  It even has a die that will do large AWG insulated cord end terminals.  I believe it can go as large as 6 AWG.  Very hard to find one that does large AWG.  As for the ratcheting mechanism and the crimp, it does not come close to knipex crimpers.  I use the knipex master crimper with die sets almost ever day and there is a huge difference.  The crimp action on the Knipex is almost effortless.  I even have a dedicated ratcheting insulated terminal crimper from knipex and it is day and night compared to astro pneumatic. That damn thing only crimps insulated terminals and it's $130.  The problem is, Knipex will not only break the bank, but it will close your account hahaha.  I paid almost $200 just for the master crimper pliers WITHOUT ANY DIES AT ALL!!!  THE DIES ALONE RUN FROM $100-$200.  Laugh all you want but while you are laughing, I just rewired and repaired a backup generator that provides back up power to hospitals when a natural disaster hits.  I bought this astro pneumatic set as a gift for an employee/apprentice of mine.  He always complains that he has to use the old style crimpers with no ratchet where you actually have to squeeze to crimp.  He has some girly hands for a field engineer.  I tried his set out and I was so glad I didn't go cheap on my own tools.  This AP set is great for the auto mechanic or electrician but not for us engineers that hold life and death in our hands.  Sound pretty over dramatic huh?  I would give it a 3.5 but I will round it up to 4 stars.  Amazon, please try and get the Knipex tool prices to go down a bit.  Thanks
