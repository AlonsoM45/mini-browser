Since I live in FL, when this hoof polish was delivered, it was extremely hot.  When I went to open it for the very first time, it sprayed out everywhere like a shaken can of soda pop.  It is very hard to remove from my skin, even with the fingernail polish remover I used. It stained my clothes permanently.
