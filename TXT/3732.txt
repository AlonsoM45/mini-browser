The wipes themselves are tough enough to do the job but don't tug too hard out of the container or else they will tear apart &#34;what makes them flushable indeed&#34;. The container is really nice but is kind of awkward in that the wipes come from the side instead of the top. The lid that comes down has a rubber ring to keep moisture in &#34;it promotes&#34; but yet the lid doesn't snap very well down. As far as on your bum, the paper is soft and ample size. I can see this paper type being way more flushable than some others out there.
