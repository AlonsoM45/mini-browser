I ordered this, focusing on the better review rather than the negative ones, and boy was I wrong to do so. I am very disappointed. The way the description was phrased, made it seem like it would work for both the DC and AC plugs, but upon arrival I realized that was not the case. Then, I had to wait three days for the converter to come. Finally, when I tried to use it, after 30 minutes it didn't even get a little warm. Also, the timer on it was extremely loud and obnoxious. I could hardly hear my TV. Can't even imagine trying to sleep with that clicking. All in all, do not buy this product, unless you just want a stiff camo blanket.
