I often find that authors of such manuals try to fit the square peg of their own experience as SF or SWAT into the round hole of operations of civilian self defenders during WROL, TEOTWAWKI etcThis often results  poorly adapted drills, comments, judgments.But none of such errors in judgement can be found in Max's book.Everything he writes makes logical and operational sense and is adapted for the situations he writes about.I am convinced that as his book "Contact" slowly percolates thru the community it will achieve cult status within a decade or two, as THE basic manual that fits the "civilian caught in SHTF" PoU.There is nothing else like it out there and IMO it's a future classic!
