I've had this monitor for several months now, and it is great. The colors are crisp and clear and it is nice and bright. I can't see any light around the edges even when the screen is displaying something with a dark background.I plug it into my MacBook Air and use an Apple Wireless Keyboard and Magic Mouse to make a desktop out of my laptop. It works pretty good.P.S. I didn't buy this on Amazon, I bought this monitor at Best Buy, but it's the same monitor.
