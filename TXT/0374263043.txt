Ms Bouton journey is shared by millions of people.  It helped me better understand my frustration and the ramifications of hearing lossI especially liked the chapter on Cochlear Implant, and the depth of her research.  That said it is very readable and doesn't require a medical background.Her journey in the opening half of her book was tedious, but laid the foundation for what followed.It has focused my own journey...and where I need to concentrate my future energies.It should be available in ENT offices.
