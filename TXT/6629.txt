&#34;Sex, The Breakfast Of Champions!&#34;A classic rivalry, awesome story, capturing events.I expecting going into this movie for it to be a straight forward racing vendetta but, it was much more than that. Being based on true events made it even more intense, It showed hardship and reminded you of the dangers sports and for some people, taught you something about yourself.In competition and life, everyone can win.
