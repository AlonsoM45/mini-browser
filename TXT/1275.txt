I havent had a cerwin vega since the 80's. I read these reviews and took a chance. There isnt many reviews out there so i feel obligated to share. Im a klipsch fan and the xls compare very well. I have the xls 6c and the xls 28's. The 6c was great and brought alot to the over all sound of my system. Very clean and dynamic. Dont wait! High end speakers is what this is for a great price. Not the smallest thing sitting under your flat screen, but well worth it. Im a CV fan once again!
