Goes against everything that nutritionists have learned in the past 75 years.From personal experience very minimal amounts of dairy and meats (preferably none at all) with the diet of vegetables, fruits, nuts,berries and seeds leaves me healthier and livelier feelingAlso forgot to mention that the lifespan of man up until modern day was much less and that disease was much more prominent with earlier man.Man still doesn't have the digestive tract for meat and dairy from animals.
