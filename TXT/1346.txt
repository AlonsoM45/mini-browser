I didn't think this series could get anymore amazing and any more heart wrenching but as always R.K Lilley NEVER fails to make me cry, laugh, scream and say &#34;oh my god!&#34; So many times. The relationship between Danika and Tristen in nothing short of steamy and a hot mess. He's a jealous maniac with the sex drive of a 16 year old boy. And it's hot!Danika's patience was tested as was Tristens. Danika had to deal with groupies from her mans past and Tristen had a hard time staying out of jail and trouble because his girlfriend is attractive and everything pisses him off. Tristen has been through a lot with the situation of his brother and now all his mother does is blame him. Some happy moments occur but are quickly shut down. These are the parts that killed me. I was rooting for them to fix the broken pieces but not everything can be mended.The story took so many different turns and now I have whip lash! I cried and yelled and I was shocked. THIS book.. This WHOLE series is just amazing. AMAZING.
