I love my old sketchers that I paid $60 for, they are about 5 years old with daily wear. They are still wearable with no tears or anything. The only reason I had to have another pair, I wore them while I was working in a kitchen for about 7 months and they are just filthy now. I have also washed them in a machine at least a dozen times. Now I use them for running shoes. I found this pair on amazon for $39.99-at Black Friday. They are hardly worth that money. They look and feel shorter in the front, a lot of the reviews say order a half size bigger, I am now regretting not listening to the reviews. If you are buying a pair on here please consider doing that. Comparing them to my other Sketcher D'Lites they come up way short in my expectations. They are cheaper for a reason. They don't even look as pretty as the ones you look at in stores.  I will update my review in a few months, right now they are a 3 stars to me, if that.
