SPOILERS INCOMING!!!It was a great book but a bit disappointing compared to all the other books because Artemis had the Atlantis complex and he so he wasn't coming up with his normal schemes and half the time he wasn't even Artemis he was that Orion guy who was really weird. All in all it just wasn't quite as intriguing as some of the previous books.
