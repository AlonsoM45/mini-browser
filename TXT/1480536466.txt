I loved this book.  The only problem is the end.  The next book doesn't come out until the summer.  I can't wait.  I want to read it now:)Absolutely loved Gavin in this book.  Didn't like Dillon, the hold he has on Emily is crazy.  I wanted to smack her sometimes for being so naive.You won't be sorry if you read this, you just might want to wait until the 2nd book comes out.  It is called Pulse.
