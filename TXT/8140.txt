"Live from Mongolia" by Patricia Sexton is a fun book with a powerful message to embrace your passions and follow your dreams.  Ms. Sexton walks away from a lucrative, although high-pressured career as a Wall Street banker to become an unpaid intern at a Mongolian television station.  As an ex-investment banker I can appreciate and admire this gutty decision.  The author uses her natural reporter's eye to paint a vivid picture of her adventures in Mongolia.  She deftly mixes in history with her personal narrative to educate and entertain the reader.  After returning to NYC, Ms. Sexton briefly returns to Wall Street, but swiftly realizes that she can no longer sell out for money.  The price is too high and there is too much to lose to walk away from her new passion in life.  This book would make a great Christmas present for high school and college students struggling with what to do with their lives.  The lesson is simple.  Throw caution to the wind, follow your heart's desire and give it everything you got.
