This book - this series - I can't even put into words how much I enjoyed reading it. Throughout the entire trilogy, there was never a moment that I considered abandoning it. Never a moment where I rolled my eyes because it was 'cheesy' or obvious. The author did a great job keeping the story interesting and 'even' - the final book, Crashed, seemed to have the most activity, but it flowed with the previous two books flawlessly. Of all the series & trilogies I have read, I have to say the Driven Trilogy is my absolute favorite. Read it. Seriously. Five stars all the way!!
