I've always loved Kingdom Hearts when I was younger but never had the system to play it on. When i finally got a PS3 I was excited to finally play all the games I hadn't gotten to when I was younger. The great thing about this version of Kingdom Hearts is that it can be played on the new PS3 models versus the regular PS2 games that are only compatible with the first few PS3 systems. I recommend this game for anyone who has a child and wants to keep them away from those violent shooters. I'm definatly going to buy Kingdom Hearts 2 when it's remade from what I read and also Final Fantasy X/X-2 when their remake is available in December!
