I was VERY happy with this product. My biggest concern was delivery and this arrived BEFORE Christmas!! THANK YOU. I ordered it close to the holiday but still received it. The jacket is good quality, my boyfriends states it's warm without being heavy and is large enough for him to fit a hoody underneath it at work. Thanks again.
