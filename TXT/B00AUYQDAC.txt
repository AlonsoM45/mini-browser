If you think you may want to read this book, do it! It's well worth the time it takes to read it. The story is original, the characters likable and an easy to follow read. The writing can get a little rough, but the imagery is usually pretty good, and you get a good idea of what everything looks like, and it leaves just the right amount to the imagination. I'm not going to ruin the story by nit-picking every scene, read if for yourself and form your own opinion.
