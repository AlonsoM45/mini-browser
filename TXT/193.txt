When I got the engine, I did probably assembled it incorrectly, because it worked for 3 days only. I contacted Dorita at Jensen, and she told me to ship it to the for repairs. They repair my engine, sent it back to me UPS second day, and they did not charged me for the repair. Excellent and friendly customer service!
