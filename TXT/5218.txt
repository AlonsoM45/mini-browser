The brush has a very strong plastic smell when it first came, the smell stayed on my daughter hair when i used it. So gross.I cleaned it with mild soap and water. The smell is still there but bearable after a day.My daughter's hair is very fine, frizzy and tangled all the time. Even sitting for a few minutes on her car seat makes her hair frizz and in knots.The brush works well and she's not in pain.I need to stroke more to untangle her hair because the bristle is shorter and reach less hair than other "traditional" brush.This brush comes in a mirror-like blue and very nice. My daughter loves it.I love this brush, i wish it doesn't have that plastic smell.
