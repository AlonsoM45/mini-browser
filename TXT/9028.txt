If you want the bass that rattles your head and face plus good mids and treble, dont waste your time more. I have 30 audiophile and basshead headphones. I can say, this is the best basshead headphones with no doubt followed by monster inspiration and sony Pulse Elite. People that comlain about the highs and mids havnt heard other headphones. You can not get better with so significant bass. Also remeber that this in a closed back headhphone. IMO this is the best you can get with maximum base and ok mids and treble. There no better option. There are better headphones for mids and highs but bass falls short on them like AKGs 702 or AD M50. Only thins is beware of sound leakage.
