I like the tight fit ,my first waist cincher you can definitely see results the first time wearing it,the second day it was a lil looser,,I just ordered another one aswell,both in a large,..prompt delivery had the first one for a week now today 3-30-14 is my third day wearing it ,, the other one is scheduled to arrive 4-1-14 since it's by the same person it should be 4* too,the reason it's not 5* is because of the itchy feeling and marks it leave on you,,I keep it on for atleast 12hrs. as I go about my day.
