I purchased the &#34;small dog&#34; sized collar. They should change the description to &#34;VERY small dog&#34;. We have two small dogs and the collars were too small for both of them even when adjusted to the largest setting on the collar.Also, the fastener that is supposed to keep the collar on the dog is too weak. A strong flea or a dog scratching himself could pull it off without even knowing it.  - I also purchased  a large collar for our large dog and put it on him. The next day, this $60 collar is gone! It had simply fallen off somewhere because of the puny little fastener design of the collar.
