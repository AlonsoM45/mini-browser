I bought this dress because I love the cross cross vintage style neckline but let me tell you this dress looks like a mess from the waist down. The nice slits you see in the pic...nope. The dress looks like a square flap hanging between your legs and is very unflattering. I took it immediately to the dry cleaner to get hemmed. We'll see how it turns out. It's 100% polyester. Too much of a hassle to send it back to china. My measurements are 5' 6&#34; (36-29-39) and it fits fine but cheaply and poorly made.
