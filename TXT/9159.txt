I was looking for a sturdy bag to carry my ostomy supplies without being too large or bulky...this fit exactly what I needed. The large inner pocket fits all of my medical essentials, and the exterior pockets fit my keys, phone, flashlight, and multi tool. As a concealed carrier, the rear pocket fits my S&W perfectly, and I even have a pocket to fit a couple of extra clips...Great Bag
