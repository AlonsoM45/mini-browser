After trying the Dixson Bass Drum Lift and listening to two bass drums side by side, one with the Dixson Lift and one without, we decided to make the investment and distribute the Dixson Lift through out the United States. This simple but effective drum accessory will create a lower tone, deeper sound, or what ever you wish to call it. All we know is drummers try it, and smile, and that says it all!! You don't drill any holes and you don't scratch your beautiful hoop. Light weight and small it will slide right into your gig bag or leave it attached to your pedal. Try it and you will never play another gig without it.
