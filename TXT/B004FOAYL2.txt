My color wheel was defective.  When installed, the wheel would bind on the light tunnel and would not spin as it is supposed to do.  The TV would not start up.  I had to pay another $120 for a repairman to diagnose the problem.  It ran fine on his bench test but not when it was installed in the TV.  The repairman had to add a spacer on the wheel in order to pull it away from the light tunnel.  I wrote the vendor but they have not replied and they expressed no concern...only silence.  Had I known I would have to spend $120 for this wheel plus another $120 (plus gas and time) to pay the repairman to fix this vendor's defective wheel I would have simply bought a new TV set.  Buyer beware.
