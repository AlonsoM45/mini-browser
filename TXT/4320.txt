You know, people talk about this baby like it's a total abomination. It's courageous I'll give it that, and it also was innovative around a time when no one wanted to do add ons. At least, not till Sega did it. So I give Sega props for 32 x. I don't think it's ugly, in fact, I think it looks neat and easy to hook up. 3 cords are a little over bearing, but the bigger issue is getting the thing to work. It does not like to work. I'm being so serious. You have to clean it with alcohol and try again and again and again. But hey, it upgrades the Genesis and makes some games sound really good, like Mortal Kombat 2. Great game by the way, though I've heard people don't like it. All in all, I give the 32 x a thumbs up because it's a nice touch for Sega and some of the games look really kool for it.
