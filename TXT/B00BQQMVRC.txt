I was a big fan of Power Rangers in the late 90s-early 00s, and I never had the original MMPR Megazord. Thankfully, this rerelease fills that void. Although not a perfect recreation of the 90s toy, it still has a vintage feel. Parts are of high-quality plastic and diecast. My only complaint is the sticker sheet. The actual stickers are placed about a half-inch to the right of the patterns (most likely a manufacturing error, and hopefully an isolated incident). Overall, this is a must-have for fans of the show from way back when!
