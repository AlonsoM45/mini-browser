I used this piece to change out an old 40+ year old blank toggle cover. They do not sell this type of cover any more with the screws in the normal place of the toggle cover screws. It was easy to put in except the holes where the screws would go for the new toggle cover were not pre drilled. I had to screw the screws in the make room and the toggle cover doesn't fit as snuggly as a I like. The room looks better especially with matching toggle and outlet covers.
