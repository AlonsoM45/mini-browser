The crate arrived in a fast and timely manner! The size is bigger than what I expected it to be, which is great for my miniature pinscher! The metal pan is very easy to clean. Sparkle is 8 weeks old and this crate is good for the  rest of her life! The color is awesome, and gorgeous! A pink crate for my princess, me and Sparkle is in  love with this crate!
