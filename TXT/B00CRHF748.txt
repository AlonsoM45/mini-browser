So i picked out a few of the free puzzles, one of them was the sea shells pack. I was down to the last two pieces. I looked at the last two pieces, then went back and swiped my finger over the puzzle to see if I had messed up. Nope, the last two pieces didn't fit the two spaces I had left. I realize I am using a free puzzle but this doesn't induce to buy the app. Otherwise I love the game and enjoy playing. Except when I have left over pieces that don't fit puzzle.
