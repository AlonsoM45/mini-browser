Ok so I&#699;m not sure what others are expecting out of a $25 fog machine...BUT, for what it IS. It&#699;s a good product.  First off...NO, it&#699;s not going to fill half a gym with fog.  And NO, it&#699;s not going to have a timer. C&#699;mon..it&#699;s UNDER 30 BUCKS!!!  It&#699;s a good machine for what it is.  If you take good care of it, it should last.  To give you an idea of how much fog it puts out.  I put a good amont of fog in my 2-car garage on just ONE blast.  After 2 or 3, the whole garage was filled.  Here&#699;s my take:PRO&#699;s:  Small, lightweight, inexpensive, decent quality built of good materials. 3-5 minute warm-up time, and same amount of time between fog blasts.  Fog blast lasts about a minute or so.CON&#699;s: Small tank.For those of you who broke it after the 1st or 2nd use.  A couple of fog machine basics:#1 CLEAN IT AFTER EVERY USE!  Dump out whatever leftover fog juice you have, put some distilled water in there, and shoot it for a few minutes.  Then dump the water and store the machine.#2 DON&#699;T RUN THE THING DRY!I&#699;m thinking about buying another one and running one on each side of my DJ rig.UPDATE:I changed my rating to FIVE ***** Stars.  Why?  Because I&#699;ve used it a few times, and it is MORE than decent for what it is. It&#699;s REALLY GOOD for what it is!  I spent less than $30 bucks on this little machine and while it&#699;s not pumping out sheets, or cloud billows of fog...it puts out more than what I expected from this machine!  I did a small (50-80 pax) DJ gig in a basketball gym, and NO...this machine DID NOT fill the place or even a quarter of the place. But what it DID do, was put enough fog in front of my lights to make it a little more dynamic up front. And that&#699;s all I expected it to do.  Did it meet my expectation?  YEP. And it exceeded it because I only filled it about 1/2 way, and that thing ran the entire gig (3-4 hours). The warm up time is around 5-7 minutes, and then it takes about the same amount of time, maybe just a little less: 3-5 minutes in between blasts, but it&#699;s good.  I think the key here is CLEANING THE MACHINE AFTER EVERY USE.  That&#699;s where people run into problems.  You cannot leave fog juice in this thing for an extended period of time. So I just run distilled water thru it after every single use.And I decided NOT to buy a second machine. Instead, when I upgrade my lightng and buy a truss system, I&#699;ll spend the money and get a bigger machine.  Until then, this little puppy does a fine job.
