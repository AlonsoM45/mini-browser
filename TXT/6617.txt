The cover fits like a glove. I chose 5 stares because of the tightness of the fit, the way it secures the Nook, and the fact that it comes with an elastic band to keep the cover closed. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a case for their Nook. The only thing that could make this better would be a magnetic closure.
