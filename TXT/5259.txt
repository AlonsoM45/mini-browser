This monitor far surpassed our expectations. The picture is very clear, night vision and daytime color. It seems to have a shorter battery life than I expected, but it's not short by any means. Just plug it in and recharge it when it's not being used. It doesn't pick up every single little sound our daughter makes, but it picks up 99% of them. It even picks up doors closing, loud cars on the road outside, and the furnace kicking on and off. I love being able to see what my daughter is doing in real time, not pixelated, and also hear her.
