This is the second time I have ordered screen protectors from this company. Both times I got super fast shipping. I was not supposed to get my product for another two days, but I got it early both times.Now time to review this particular screen protector, It seems like good quality, However, It does not grant as much privacy as a similar tech armor screen protector. Downfall for this screen protector is that it isnt as private as the tech armor one. Good thing though, is you get 3 screen protectors for around $5. But the Tech armor privacy screen protector was $8 for a pack of one!I would have given 5 stars, but it just isnt as private as other ones.
