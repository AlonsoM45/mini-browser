I bought this retail model and after 2 weeks it died on me. I was not happy at all so luckily I could return it. I went and bought the Airfloss Dental Pro Model since it said it was a lot better. Well I am happy to report that the dental pro model is still working fine after 3 months. The battery life on the pro model is better too from what they said. That's being said it worth the extra money.
