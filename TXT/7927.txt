This castle is wicked cute but I didnt realize how big it was! And it has poles which I didnt realize either. I thought for some reason it would just &#34;POP&#34; up when taken out but the poles make sense when looking at it to keep the steeple up. My mistake but my kids love it and we found a place for &#34;Santa&#34; to put it on Christmas Eve. Its now back in the bag and will come out when we make room in a bedroom!
