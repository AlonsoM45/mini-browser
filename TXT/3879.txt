I originally had four of the under the counter lights but soon found out that they are so handy I purchased two more.  I have to admit that none of mine are "under the counter".  I have them just inside my closets and the utility room that is usually quite dark.  I have two that I place around the house by setting them on dressers, end tables, or anywhere I may need them when I get up very early in the morning or anytime at night.  I sometime use one as a very handy flashlight when I enter a dark room.  I have been very pleased with the ease of purchase, the ease of installation, customer service, and how long they last.  For a small light they put out a tremendous amount of bright light.
