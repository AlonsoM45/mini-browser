I got this exact case for $20 and my friend got the orange one just like it, within less than a week the camo print on the back was already worn off. I'm guessing its because of how its printed on the case, and it doesn't help that I'm a teenager. I believe that the case is and "felt" cheap. I feel like it was a waste of my money and should've spent it on a different case.
