Great song. I love all things Bond (Even Die Another Day) and when I first heard this new song I thought, &#34;Yes! Finally a good old fashioned (yet somehow still new age) Bond theme. And it's by Adele! That will DEFINITELY score me points with the ladies if I start listening to Adele!!&#34; It has yet to score me any points with the ladies. Besides this song and that one about defying the laws of physics by lighting water on fire, it has mostly just annoyed me. But I'm getting sidetracked... Great song! Good going, Adele, you're not completely useless.
