I got this app as faotd. I listen to audiobooks and play this game to unwind before bed. Problem is if I don't set an alarm I lose track of time, which in my opinion is what makes a good app. It has enough settings to let you choose exactly how difficult  you want it. The animations are cute but eats the batteries.
