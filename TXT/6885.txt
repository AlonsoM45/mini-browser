I just received and set up the lighting studio. Directions were lacking simple, step-by-step walkthroughs for set-up but fortunately a lot of the stand equipment is modular and easily figured out. I did have a broken 105w CFL due to handling issues which I do not attribute to ePhoto and Amazon was great to refund a discount to my account to procure a replacement on their behalf. As far as the lighting is concerned - I was skeptical of using CFL for my main lighting but I have since changed my mind. I was pleasantly surprised at the intensity and saturation of the light. There are 4 combinations of lighting using the inner diffuser, outer, both or none. My 4 star rating is based on a decent product of good quality but lacks simple, comprehensive installation instructions for all the equipment in the kit.
