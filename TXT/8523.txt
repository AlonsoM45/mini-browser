Magic, mystery, illusion, tension, love and a beautiful story line make this movie really worth watching! I watched this film some time ago, but still can remember as one of the most interesting movies. Probably one of the things that made me love this film is the idea about mystery or in other words about illusionist. That kind of thing always was interesting to me. Moreover, this movie kept the tension and intrigue till the end. The most interesting part was that the main trick, the main illusion was going in a different way that a spectator could think of. I don't want to uncover the plot here, because it will be more interesting to watch it for yourself. I greatly recommend The Illusionist for everyone who likes mysteries and tangled plots.
