After going through FIVE Lifeproof cases (insane!), I finally tried the Catalyst + Survivor case. Overall I was happy with the case; the design, screen protector, and audio quality were excellent. BUT, there is one major flaw, the plastic that covers the camera lens completely blurs all of your photos. I have tried 2 different cases, both with the same problem. So unfortunately I cannot recommended this case to anyone who takes lots of photos with their iPhone.I hope Griffin will fix this issue, because it's a great waterproof case otherwise.
