The product description says HP genuine displayport to vga adapter but the the adapter I received says Foxconn on the back and is made on China. It does not look like the product advertised in the picture. And the worst thing: does not work with my HP Envy X2 laptop. The conector is to big or wide to fit on the displayport socket. Sold by Compeve. I want to return this.
