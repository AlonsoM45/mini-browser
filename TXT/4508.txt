Im using it right now to type! Its great. Windows 8 is stupid feels more like im using a phone and Ive caught myself trying to use the screen as a touch lol but overall its nicely built, works well and is really cute. I would recommend for a younger crowd and those who dont want much memory as I have used most of mine in less then a month! But I have alot of songs, apps, movies etc...
