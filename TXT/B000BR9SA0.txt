So glad i bought this season One, when I got the season two. I almost didn't, thinking, ahhh, I have seen it years ago. Well, little did i realize, how much I had forgotten of the show. SOOOO glad i purchased this. HIGHLY Recommend to all DSV fans., and a big WeLcOmE to anyone new to watching. No regrets with owning this, other than, I wish the series had lasted much longer.. Loved the show, and still do. Glad to revisit this series. HIGHLY Recommend seller too., an Honest, Reliable, seller. Quick ship.
