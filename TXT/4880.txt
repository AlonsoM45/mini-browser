This was literally the fastest none amazon prime shipping I have ever encountered. I ordered it on a Sunday night, it shipped on Monday and I got it today (Wednesday). As far as the product it was also the easiest screen protector I have ever put on before. I have never been able to get a screen protector on without air bubbles before. The only thing I do not like about this product is because it is matte, it has a pixel look when it is on the phone. On top of the pixel look it also has a little bit of a rougher feeling to it. But besides those two little points I can get over, this is the perfect screen protector!
