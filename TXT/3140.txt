I played the actual card game for a while and was hoping to reconstruct an old favorite deck to see how it would stand up in the ratings. However, this piece of crap app demands that you have a Facebook profile and that you &quot;become a fan&quot; to get more content (which I have discovered to be the card database).I don't have a Facebook account, nor do I want a Facebook account. If I could speak to the developer of this sh***y app, I'd tell him exactly what he can do with it.I'm very honest about my ratings; I don't say something is good when it isn't. Giving this app 1 star is actually giving it more than it's due. If you're reading this and have ANY common sense, take my advice: look somewhere else.
