the Jolie Pleasures Plug is not that good of a product for a few reasons, first of all it is very soft and is very flexible which you may think is a good thing untill you try and leave it there without using the finger hold, i almost lost it inside myself on a few occasions that is why iv stopped using it, but if your looking for something that you dont just want to keep in place then i would recomend it just dont ever let go of the finger hold
