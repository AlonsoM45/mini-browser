I ordered these, expecting them to be cheap, but they were very nice. The color was identical to my Leg Avenue Classic Cinderella costume, and they are very smooth & sturdy. It really added that extra touch to my costume, and I'm really glad I got them. Now, however, I have relatively long/narrow fingers, so it may not fit as well if you think you have thicker fingers. But for me, they fit like a glove *ba dum tsss*.
