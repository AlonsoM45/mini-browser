Not sure why other people don't like these, The brushes arrived in perfect condition,I received this package in the mail, the brush set is not professional quality, but It is great for me, because I practiced nail art on my own nails, make beautiful lines The handles are made of hard plastic, the only thing is the brushes that i purchased are not the same as the picture.
