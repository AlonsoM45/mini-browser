I purchased the same seat 6 years ago at another outlet.  The seat has served me tremendously well.  While there has been some tarnishing on the metal hinge parts, I regularly clean with white vinegar and baking soda and it looks like new again.  I am remodeling 2 bathrooms and I have ordered these same toilet seats again.  This toilet seat will compliment any decor with an understated elegance, I received plenty of compliments when guests visit the powder room.
