Are you tired of your life? Do exactly the same Mondays and other days of the week don't make sense to you? Do you feel that there is something more waiting in life for you? If you have such or similar questions I believe this book can be an answer for you! But just reading it and not practicing is not going to make any changes in your life!This book is sequel to Robin's bestseller The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari. Basically it's very similar to the mentioned book, but everything is expanded and explained in more details. The plot is simple, the same monk who sold his Ferrari is sharing his wisdom with the man who has everything in life, but lost meaning of it. He almost ended with a suicide, but accidentally something stopped him and that something became a breakthrough in his life.What I like in this book is that Sharma takes us step by step through all 7 steps of self-awakening. In a story telling way he explains us why they are important and how you can master them. He gives us many advices and insights that can help to transform anyone's life. To make those steps and advises more emphasized the hero of the books teaches his apprentice one step at a time, by showing a lesson each time and making him to experience everything by himself, not just to hear the advice. That makes this book more practical to use for everyone who want great changes in their lives.I believe there are many lost souls in this world and this practical book can really help to find a real yourself and a real meaning of your life. Even if this one book won't help, I believe it will be a first huge step to discover your destiny!So, is your next Monday going to be the same as your last 30 Mondays?!
