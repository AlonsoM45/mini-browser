This was seriously the most perfect conclusion to the Trust Me Trilogy! It was just how I pictured it would be. I'm kind of a sucker for sweet stories like this but it wasn't all that sweet thanks to Alistair. There were plenty of times when I wanted to punch that old man in the throat. Aiden at times was so passive. I felt like he just let the insults slide one too many times. But after all that is his father and they love each other no matter what. At times I wanted to shake Jenny and make her realize that Alistair didn't have power over her. Once she got into her story with Jason I understood it all. She was out through way too much. It's a lot to handle for one person.Callie and mike made me super happy by the way! Overall this was a great conclusion to this trilogy. It's romantic yet frustrating at times. Book 1 and 2 must be read before this one. Amazing job Miss Osborn I can't wait for more to come from you!
