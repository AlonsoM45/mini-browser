What we were looking for were the extension lines with microphone in each unit so everyone can hear when a call comes in.  This unit works great.  Now we have no problem getting to the phone, and don't have to run through the house to answer incoming calls.  Our main telephone line stopped working, and the only working line was in the office... on the other side of the house.
