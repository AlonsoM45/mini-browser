I ordered this item and it shipped one day later than mentioned, although not a big deal. It also worked (pretty well) for 2 days and not does not work at all. When plugged in, it no longer lights up or turns on. It also had a VERY strong plastic odor smell that made me nervous. I am very unhappy and upset that i wasted my money and my patience on this order.
