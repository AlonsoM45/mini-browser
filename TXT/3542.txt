Man these things are bulky!!  They sound VERY good. The controls are nice.  The mic works without fiddling with it.  I have found that they can last for 5-6 hours of non stop use.  The charging cable plugs in the back so you can still use when plugged in.  Works on my PS3 as well as my computer.  I think they were worth the purchase.
