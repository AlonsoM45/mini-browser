It does "Work" as stated, and I would have given it a 5 star rating, but the sling swivel kit needs to come with not just the long wood/plastic screw base mount, but needs to also include a shorter base mount wood/plastic screw.  I had to customize/shorten the long base screw that's used for wood/plastic stocks, so it would fit my pistol grip folding stock, but the sling kit mounts do give a strong anchor point for your sling , and they look good when installed, and it functions great with my condor brand name sling.JM
