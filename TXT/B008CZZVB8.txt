This kit has all the stuff you&#699;ll need, (and some stuff you don&#699;t) and it wasn&#699;t extremely expensive.  The only thing I added was an airway for CPR, and some extra bandages of different sizes, and a small tube of antibiotic. There are bandages and single use antibiotic packs...but I needed more.  I use this kit for a summer program in Hawaii, and our kids are always getting small cuts and scrapes because we&#699;re outdoors quite a bit. So bandages and antibiotic are the first to go.I think it&#699;s well laid out, everything is clearly marked, and the clear plastic helps a lot when you&#699;re trying to find stuff. I also like the bright orange color and large print: MEDICAL KIT on the side, makes it easy to locate.  I would recommend this kit to anyone who is going to be outdoors on the water or in the mountains. I gave it 4 stars because I had to add those items, and I&#699;ll probably have to add some sunburn treatment (aloe gel or other), and an instant ice pack or 2, but other than that this kit is good.On a side note... yes I probably could have put together a kit of exactly what I needed so there wouldn&#699;t be any wasted space or unusable items, for about the same price or less...possibly.  But I knew going into this purchase that I was going to add a few things to supplement this kit for my needs so no big deal.  And I was impressed by the layout of the bag, and it&#699;s content.  If you want to see what&#699;s inside, Adventure Medical&#699;s website has some really good video&#699;s on all of their kits.
