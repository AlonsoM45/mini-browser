The Masters saga is good since it ties in the story for the Robotech series. Yes Dana's character is a scatterbrain but she isn't too serious either. I wish they would have made episodes for after the Masters and into when the Invid arrived for more detail about what happened to the Army of the Soutern Cross and the members of 15th squadron.
