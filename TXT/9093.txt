Not only does this tank not work as promised, it is also too small. Any fish living in it won't grow any more than an inch or live past 6 months due to the size of the &#34;tank&#34;. Instead of this, go get a REAL fish tank. Most fish need 5-10 gallon tanks, and they aren't that expensive either. Depending on the type of fish, they need a heater, a air stone, and a filter. With all of these, the fish will most likely will live at least 5 years.
