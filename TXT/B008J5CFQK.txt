It's not the best tasting in the world, but it's not that bad. You only hold it under your tongue for about 30-60 secondsn 2x a day then swallow. You can drink something afterwords. Besides, I lost 10lbs. in 2 weeks of taking it in conjunction with the rasberry ketone. So I can definitely handle the taste. I'm not sure what percentage the chlorogenic acid is in it. But however I did loose weight. And the first 2 bottles (green coffee extract and rasberry ketone) I bought cost me $70.00. So this time due to a friend I ordered here on Amazon and got both the green coffee bean and rasberry ketone and added the african mango extract for about $45.00. I'm still waiting on my order but hopefully it will come in tommorow. I've been out for about a week and I can definetly feel a difference. Also remember taking this in liquid form makes it work faster since it is absorbed immediately under the tongue. Also this product is completely natural absolutely no additives. It is from Essential Source. You can check their website on these and other products. They have other products that I will be getting in the future but I will be ordering it from Amazon (way cheaper). Hope this helps anyone wanting to try it.
