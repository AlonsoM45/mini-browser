I have read about 30 books on the Biblical translation issues, but the author approaches the issue as a professor of English rather than from theology or textual issues.  While I disagree with the author on his preference for the critical text (which he never discusses, but obviously prefers the English Standard Version), I appreciated his critique of the modern translations as inferior from the point of view of English literature.
