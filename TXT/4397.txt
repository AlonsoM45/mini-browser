The boys are just amazayn. When you think about it their was a lot of loans the boys had to take out to get this far. One of my friends thought that one direction was just stuck up and snobby  (how dare them I know) but when she read this book she realized that they really are caring and kind. I mean sure they have lots of money, but that's not the most important thing to them.
