Its an amazing helmet. Fits perfect to scale. only bad thing was the chin. its there to stop a lot of air from coming in but also prevents you from opening your mouth. I think it could've been more comfortable as well as flexible or adjustable. Another bad thing is the color. it gets dirty so fast. the finger prints are very noticeable and so are any little scratches. aside from those two bad things the helmet itself is amazing. fits perfect, looks great, feels great, the internal sunglasses are a big bonus, and the mechanisms on the helmet are cool. Great Helmet for that price!! Will def. buy another if I need too.
