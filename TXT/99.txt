I am a newbie at buying\using usb sticks. I found out I could store full length movies on them & play them back on my tv with a fairly low cost media player. I think it's pretty neat to be able to store 5 or 6 movies on a 16 gig little stick & watch them on tv without messing with storing DVD's. I don't know much about these sticks or how long they should last etc., but hey, no moving parts! I bought this item at a very reasonable price & shipping was pretty good. Would buy again. Probably soon.
