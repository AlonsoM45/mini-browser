I do like this show, and have bought two of my favorites, however, some episodes I just couldn't understand. "Screams in the Desert" was one of them. Why would you meet someone who is making your life a living hell alone in the Desert??!! The one with the opera singer I felt was way over the top. Other than some others, this is a great show. It is worth watching!
