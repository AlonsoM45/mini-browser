I just recived this very nice but made on the cheap side if you tighten the bolts to much metal bends also has some broken clips and scratches on it. in the prosses of working on a return for a new one.. but very nice to relax on if you are not a picky person this is the swing for you.. I am a QC guy at work so any damage sticks out well I give this swing 7 out of ten enjoyYork pa
