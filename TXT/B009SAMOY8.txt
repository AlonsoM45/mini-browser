I am 59 and primary cook "certified foodie" in the family. My wife has asked me to prepare special diets to keep weight down for both of us at times. My experience has been that while we have kept weight off with South Beach, long term shopping requirements were too intense and unsustainable. The meals were also not satisfying for the level of cooking I enjoy. We would go on South Beach and lose weight, go back to normal schedule and put weight back on and repeat process. The cauliflower "fake mashed potatoes" grew pretty weary as a Julia old school French cooking fan. Forget the no wine phase. Great glass of wine after a long day is well deserved. There are several pretty good meals on Doctor Oz such as the tofu tacos and shredded chicken BBQ that really surprised me and are normal weekday new additions worth a Google.About six months ago I started many of the recommendations mentioned in the book before even reading it. I get to keep my passion for trying new dishes with best fresh ingredients but just limited portions. In the past I would eat whatever portion the host or host put on the plate so as not to offend. Now I always tell the host or hostess I am on portion control but want to sample every thing they have prepared.Bottom line, I would rather have a small serving of great food than my previous life where the pounds would add up with no portion control. Add a reasonable level of exercise and I have dropped weight from 180 to 160 in six months and still look forward to dinner!A nice add on to this book might be the best dishes author has tasted in his travels. If I am going to have less, I want the best.
