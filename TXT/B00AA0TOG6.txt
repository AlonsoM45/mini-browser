This game is much more challenging than it appears to be at first. I love the use of tools to help get players from one level to another. The &#34;out-of-the-box&#34; thinking that is required is enjoyable and challenging. However, only one hint is provided at each level, and it is not always helpful. Since there is no other strategy guide, going online for help is a nuisance. It is also frustrating to have to begin each level from the start when you  repeatedly get burned or eaten, etc.
