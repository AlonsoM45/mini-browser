Putting it together was easy but the quality isn't that great. I thought I would really like the double bar but without having it sideways you really can't see the clothes on the back row. The bars are adjustable so I have the front bar all the way down and the back bar up high so I can have it against the wall. I ended up having a closet built so I use this rack at our Pawn Shop and seems to work well there.
