To begin with, PS4 was very difficult to buy. Amazon received some stock from time to time but minutes later they were already gone. I bought mine in January and received it within 3 days.The console itself is great - the looks, the way it works, etc. One of the things I like the most is the ability to plug in your headphones directly to DS4.No 'blue light of death' so far :) (some people experienced this problem during the first couple of hours of using PS4) - I've been playing AC4 for about 40-50h now.Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase
