Perfect for what I needed. Even if I was going to wear it, it would have been great. I actually needed it for a present to put on a stuffed animal, so I have zero complaints. Not sure how long the clear rubber wire would hold up if you're trying to wear this thing around, but it seems stretchy and for the price, you cant beat it. Good luck finding this around your neighborhood. You guys rock for having this!
