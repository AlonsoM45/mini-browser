3.5 starsThis book was better than I expected. Yeah, the fact that it's about elemental powers has something to do with it and the fact that the main character has the power of my favorite element, fire, has a lot to do with it, but it was just a good book overall.Yeah, I think this review will be a bit short, but I don't have a lot to say about it, so. And it's not a bad thing! The story was good, the writing was good, the romance was good. It was just a good solid book! And yeah, pretty original too. And I'm happy the author gave me a chance to read it. I loved the world she build in this book and how she handled the paranormal stuff in it. Yeah, elemental powers are a weakness of mine, so it was hard to not like this book. But if it wasn't that good, I would've been honest about it. Not everyone can get it right, but Jessie did.I liked the characters, they were pretty well-developed and I liked most of them. Kiarra is cool, with the power of fire and all that. Wish I was her. Or rather, wish I had her power. Jaxton was.... yum first of all. He was cool and I loved getting to know him. And I loved Neena too. Again, all of the characters were great. And I can't wait to see what happens next, what their new adventure is.The book is the start of a new series and I'm pretty excited about it. I want to know what happens next! So yeah, I liked the book and I'm going to read the next books in the series.
