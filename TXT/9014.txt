I read this book in one sitting, it was too hard to stop.  I felt like if I stopped reading and picked it up at a different time it wouldn't have had as much of an impact on me. This book made me feel more emotions in its 213 pages than in any other book I've read.  And it was so relatable!Best money I've spent in a while, worth the read definitely!
