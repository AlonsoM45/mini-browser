Ordered these shorts in one size but, they did not have them in stock when they were filling my order...which happens sometimes, so they sent me an email, they were honest about the facts, offered me 3 or 4 different alternatives, we had some extremely prompt back and forth email dialog about the shorts in a different size and my order was filled. Honesty and Integrity in today's business world...What a breath of fresh air!! AND the best part Mike, the owner, is an Infantry Veteran who has taken his discipline and values from the military and brought them to this business he is supporting is family with...Just so everyone is clear...I DO NOT know Mike but, ELITE HERO is now in my book in more ways than one!!! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!
