Excellent book - short yet with 'meaty' information that makes you look at things in a different light. The CBS principle is on one hand common knowledge yet on the other helped me analyze a tough negotiation in a way I never did before - is one example to the added value this book has.A unique and inspiring voice in the 'negotiation' section.
