The hose leaked both where it connected to the house and the spray nozzle, even though I removed the extra attachment before connecting the nozzle.  It would stop leaking at the nozzle occasionally but continually leaked at the house connection.  It finally started leaking so bad at the nozzle that I lost pressure.  I finally threw it out and bought a different hose.
