These are comfy, wick moisture, and fit very well with my vibram five fingers. I wanted them for the Fall, to run in cooler weather w/out freezing my tootsies off. I plan to get a pair for my ultra marathon running father in law. He wears regular sneakers, but these are great for blister prevention as well.
