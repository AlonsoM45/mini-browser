I have purchased this product several times and have gotten the same poor results, the adhesive sucks.  I have used it to hang many small objects, such as a tv remote, a small alarm clock or even to hide wires unde a cabinet.  The adhesive just does not stick well to anything, except itself.  I have no complaints about the hook and loop side, but it is certainly not anything that should be called &#34; industrial strength&#34; if the adhesive cant even hold up a tv remote,  3M please fix this problem, I know you have better permanent adhesive that can withstand a warm surface, but this product adhesive is a big FAIL!
