We were hoping that this would make the water tolerable, but it didn't.  This would probably work fine if you don't have a LOT of iron;  we do and it just didn't remove enough.  We even had a whole house filter before it.  It was terrible for drinking and we incurred stained sinks, toilets and even laundry; therefore, we had to go back to a water softener.
