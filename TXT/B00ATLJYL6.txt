So having read the book, I too was at first confused on a lack of stuff from the book. However for anyone who read it, that movie would have had to been a lot longer to include it all! When you realize that, they included a lot of good stuff!! I really enjoyed Chase Williamson as David! I think he got it perfect, and the Dave/John dynamic was excellent!!! I will not include any spoilers, however I will say to anyone who has not read the book, you will more than likely not have any clue what the hell is going on, so just watch it for entertainment!!!I really hope this movie does well enough for the sequel, because TBIFOS is definitely movie worthy!!!!
