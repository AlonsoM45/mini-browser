I find it interesting that the investigator in this vampire game looks like Keanu Reeves. When he talks, with that British voice, it throws me a little. I wouldn't say fixing things in the boiler room are adventurous, but maybe that's why I don't get paid the big bucks. I'm not very far into the game but so far I have no idea where it's going. So far the games seem pointless. But try the game for yourself. It's not the worst game I've ever played but I'm not sure if it'll make it to my faves list either.
