I chose 5 out of 5 for this because this game is original, traditional fun.  This is one of the few 3d games for Sonic the Hedgehog that actually satisfies.  A lot of people say it's a rip off of Mario Party, but they're wrong. While it does share a few of the same elements namely because it's a gameboard based platform game, the music and overall experience is totally different. In this you shuffle cards, you don't hit dice.  In this game it's wittier and more intriguing.  It is refreshing and interesting to see how Sega woulda have done it. The intro to the game was nice, the story is fluent, and some of the minigames are a little odd, while providing humor and fun.  There's a bit of button mashing but not an awful lot to hurt your thumb or get sore in your palms, and the controls were developed well.  The levels were pretty kool. I really liked playing on the ship and the train, and in outer space. The other very exciting thing about this game is that when you fight the boss, they still have an actually boss area, with switches you must hit, not to mention that all Sonic's friends (Knuckles, Tails and Amy) get to join.  The boss and story to this game was very odd yet satisfying. Great job Sonic!
