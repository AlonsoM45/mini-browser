For the money paid I guess this Cleaning kit is OK, but the wooden box it come with is not of high quality, (crooked rear mounted hinge, and smeared stain, or paint on the top lid, also the kit I received states 42 pieces, and not 35 pieces as the sellers ad stated, so I guess it depends on how they count the included items in this kit, again the gun cleaning kit is OK, but nothing special, not of high quality, but for the money I guess it's an OK kit.
