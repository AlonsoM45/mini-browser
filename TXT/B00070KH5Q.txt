I was hoping the front sight wouldn&#699;t extend over the cut out on the top of my Glock 34...and it doesn&#699;t!  It fits just fine.  Tritium glows at dusk, and really glows in darkness!  I left it in the box it shipped in, and then pulled it out in pitch darkness...and it was glowing just fine.  For the price...I&#699;ll put these on my Glock 17 as well!
