Very interesting and inspiring work on governance that could be used for leadership. It's a political treatise and even though this book was written about 500 years ago, all the principles described in the book works very well these days. A very interesting look at the reasons, methods and differences of the governance is presented.Niccolo Machiavelli wrote this treatise as a gift for his those days king. The reason to do so was to explore and to describe the methods on how to govern a country. Actually everything is very easy presented. The author starts by describing differences between the counties and then gets into how and why those counties or areas should be governed. The book is full of real life examples of other nations in different times. Machiavelli describes why some of the countries or empires expanded and why some of them collapsed. Everything is easy explained and it's not difficult to notice, that most of the methods he wrote about are used by today politicians or leaders.As I've read a lot of books on leadership, this one was really interesting because of its age. Actually it might look like this book is more about management, but really there are a lot of hints and methods that turns on to leadership. Furthermore, firstly kings had to be leaders to keep the power in their hands.Moreover, what I liked more about this book, is a deeper look and understanding on how countries are created, what agreements you should make and what you shouldn't do to win. The book revealed many intrigues between kings and their relatives, which led to betrayals and deaths. To conclude everything, I think that the most important thing is not to get the power - it's to keep it for a lifetime and to be remembered as the greatest!Any thoughts? Please, share.
