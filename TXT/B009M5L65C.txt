It fits like a hard case on back and keeps it tight, the back is that gel rubber which i don't care for as it tends to be slippery especially with oily hands like me and leaves streaks. The sides are a rubberish grip but more hard like a plastic than real rubber. It's ok but the perfect one would be this with real rubber gripping bumper sides with a back the same.
