This cook book drew me in because it gives extensive details about diets. Most cook books only give you recipes but this cook book explains to you what a diet really is. It also teaches you about diseases that being overweight can cause. It taught me what foods were good and bad for me. It also taught me how to save money with this new diet. This was really helpful to me. The recipes in this book were very easy to make.
