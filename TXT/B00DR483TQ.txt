This is a really nice book. Haven't made any of the flowers yet but when I do I think I will combine some of the flowers to give a more realistic /3D effect. It will be fun to play with these patterns and see what I come up with. My only problem with this book was that some of the flowers looked rushed and sloppy. Thank you for the book. I love that this book  has sparked my and my daughter's imagination. The finished photo of the flowers were great, I've got other books where the photo of finished project was not included and the pattern itself wasn't clear. This book also jumps right into the patterns with the understanding that person reading the book has a basic understanding of  crochet. Most books out there start by teaching crochet. Which is nice, but most people looking for patterns are doing so because they know how to crochet and are looking for something to make.
