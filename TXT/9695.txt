This is another great shape from Cleo. I wear this, the Marcie, and the Lucy all in a 28G. It runs true to size and creates a really nice upfront and projected profile. I was tentative to try the Lily because it's based off the Meg, which is a notoriously difficult fit, but Cleo made great improvements to this style. I would be hesitant to recommend this to anyone who is very full on top or very full on bottom though. They may not be able to fill out the top or may experience cutting in along the top. It works well because I'm evenly shaped.
