The box is way bigger then expected!! Its huge!!! lol I scored this baby when it was on sale for 12 bucks!!!!!! =)) Got it for my nephew for xmas. Hes autistic so I dont like to buy him gifts just for boys I like to get him something more personal and this is what he wanted! He loves it! Its really a great buy!
