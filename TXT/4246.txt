I have been looking to replace my old, hightech ipad2 cover with a blue tooth wireless keyboard for quite some time now.  But didn't want to spend too much a second time.  This cover is not only extremely affordable but it is actually very smart and handy.  I highly recommend it to someone who is looking to get something under $10!
