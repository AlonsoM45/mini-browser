I like it, easy to install and each has 100watt bulbs you can direct in three directions. Only thing that is kind of annoying is the foam gasket that suppose to help against the wall. I think they should have made that into the part itself to begin with, but hey its made in China. Overall finish is nice and metal, will hold up good. Sensor is adjustable from the outside which is nice as some other lights you have to adjust from the inside.
