For the money I think this is really good hardware for my intended purpose. I bought this hardware pack so I could setup a practice kit in my spare bedroom since all my other high end hardware is utilized on other kits. I have to admit it's quite basic and fairly lightweight, but it serves it's intended purpose well. Even the kick pedal has descent action after I got it dialed in and put a better beater on it. I wouldn't recommend this hardware to anyone who does a lot of gigging because I don't think it would hold up to all the rigors of constant setup and teardown. I would spend the extra bucks on something more high end for gigging drummers. If you're just looking for stands for a rehearsal or a beginner kit, than I highly recommend this hardware pack.
