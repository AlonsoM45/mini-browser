i was so excited to try this...it ended up to be a let down.the suedeberry is much more orange-y than it looks.yes it applies like a gloss and dries very matte... so matte that it was actually flaking off my lips, but it wouldn't stay anywhere near the middle/inner parts of my lips.removing this was not exactly easy either.
