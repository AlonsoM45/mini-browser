The roadster 2 works fine when its on but when i return to my car after a period of time it does,nt come on. I have to shut it down manualy wait a few minutes and it comes back on.It doesnt do it everyday but at least two,three times a wk i have to do this. Batt is in high charge and phone is on. Im not happy w/roadster2 at all.Its hard to answer the phone when the darn thing is nt on As of this month8/23/13 the roadstar sucks I would not recommend this item to anyone.The problem has been there since day one.I know now its to late to return item but for anyone that wants  one deont do it because all my friends are having the same problemEarl Garrant748 oneil rd. west chazy ny 12992
