This is an excellent, well written set of horror stories. The first two are like dark fairy tales. With This Ring has little mazes as illustrations of key plot points. The third story takes a psychological turn. In Losing Dan the question of 'I wonder what they were thinking just before that unthinkable act' is answered. I almost wish it was left unanswered, I had such a strong visceral reaction to this story. The fourth story is about a woman who moves into a literally distressed property. I particularly like the ending. Special mention has to go to the last story in the collection, Flood of Darkness. If the best part of Losing Dan was getting into someone's mind then it is fitting that the final story not only delves into the mind of its troubled narrator but also provides a suspenseful story about a natural disaster. Things get very intense before the completely satisfying end. I'll be looking for more by this author.
