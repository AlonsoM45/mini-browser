I used this on bedbugs in a friends wheelchair(seriously! I'm not making this up) and all I can say is,&#34;holy crap! Don't use this indoors! Certainly not in a small room! I didn't get any on me and I was almost incapacitated! I was coughing and eyewatering, and my poor friend who couldn't walk and stuck in the room with the vapors! If you use this , be ready to deal with the consequences!  Good stuff!
