I bought this camera bag for my t3i 6 months ago. Originally I had a 17-50mm and a 50mm alongside extra batteries and a lens cleaning kit.When I first started out, it was ok at best.Pros:It held my 50mm, 17-50mm, body, my extra batteries, and a charger, as well as various other things.I especially like the side pockets, perfect for the 'extras' I had in my pocket.There are straps on the bottom, and I occasionally kept a small tripod attached to them, which was nice.The bag shows no signs up wear, and appears to be very rugged.I was able to re-arrange the compartments to hold my gear more securely.Cons:The strap clips don't rotate, so I was constantly having to untangle it.The material is abrasive, so don't rub up against it.The bag isn't exactly super-light. It isn't bad, but it certainly isn't great.I quickly ran out of room as I upgraded my kit.The compartment system is a bit odd. It consists of velcro and padded fabric. It holds things in place fairly well, but it rarely maintains the shape I want, so I sort of have to re-arrange it each time I put lenses back.Way too expensive for what I got.Overall, I thought the bag was very too expensive for what I got. I would suggest investing it a low-key off-brand bag for your camera, and to steer clear of this one. Unless you only need a back-up bag, and don't mind spending too much money on it.
