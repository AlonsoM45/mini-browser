Wallet has the capacity to hold what I need -- various cards, paper money, coins and keys.  Its appearance is acceptable, and I like the window that shows my driver's license without having to take it out of the wallet.  However, the wallet's coin purse is not durable.  The fabric inside the leather cover has frayed, and the snap is coming loose.  I've had to use tape to hold the cover together.
