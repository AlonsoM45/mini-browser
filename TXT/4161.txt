I love this strope!  Works well.  The only problem was of its length as well as its mislead picture.  The length just makes it a little more a hassle where you would have to repeat the runs on strope a few more times.  The two seperate stropes you see on the picture is actually one strope.  Overall, been using straight razors for a while and can honestly say this is a great buy!
