Well, I could not put the book down.  If it was really possible for an Amish man to be President, it would be a great day for our nation.  The values in the book Josiah had are exactly what the Amish believe and at one time the citizens of America had those same values, but they appear to be disappearing.  Oh how we need leadership like Josiah!!
