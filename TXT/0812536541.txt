I picked up the book from my school library, and I immediately noticed that the environment posed to the reader by Barron is amazing, and you immediately find yourself immersed in the book. I did not entirely enjoy the book, as it was not really fitting of some of my own preferences, but I can't bring down any stars solely for my personal preference. The book is smooth, (a little slow at a couple of times), innocent, and, in a sense, refreshing. The writing is simple and easy to follow. I can see younger readers finding it many times more enjoyable than I did, and I highly recommend it to anybody within the recommended age group.
