I'm one of those women who was blessed with the darkest, coarsest leg hair, which begins to stubble literally as soon as I finish shaving. The second I step out of the hot shower, I get goosebumps and might as well have not bothered shaving at all. So, I have been looking around at other hair removal methods for summertime, but have been intimidated by wax strips of other brands. My sister (who has sparse, blonde leg hair) uses the Sally Hansen strips, and not only does the later redness look painful (it usually lasts a full day), but she has to go back over her legs several times to get even half the hair off. I vowed to never even attempt those!So, I did some intense research before deciding on a product, and these Veet strips seemed to have great overall reviews. Despite my first impression of wax strips, I picked up a box of these yesterday to try. After a bit of stalling, I warmed up the first strip and got ready to wax! It didn't necessarily feel pleasant, but I would call it more of an annoying sting than pain. Keep in mind, this was my first time waxing my legs, so I was probably more sensitive than those who have waxed before. There was virtually no wax left on my legs (just a little where the bottom edge of the strip was placed), and the slight redness lasted less than an hour. I only had to use one clean-up pad per leg, and even that was mostly to see how well they worked (if they got the minimal leftover wax, if they burned at all, if they left my legs shiny like the ad boasted). The pads did leave my legs super smooth and shiny, but my only complaint is that the floral/clean fragrance of them wasn't amazing. It wasn't bad, it just reminded me of my grandmother's perfume. The good thing is that the smell is easily covered with scented lotion. Anyway, this wax kit definitely exceeded my expectations and was easy for a first-timer. I will try to update in the future about the long-term use of these.
