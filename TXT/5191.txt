This speaker is simply unbelievable!. The sound very loud and best thing of all is that it has real punchy bass. Even at high volumes the speaker never distort. I was really surprised by how good these speakers are.I own the following bluetooth speakers:GoGroveHMDX JamHMDX Jam PlusKinivo MiniSuper Bass Portable SpeakerX-mini Max II Capsule Speakersand after testing all of them i can say that the Sharkk BoomBox is a killer! There's no comparison at all. Previously, the HMDX Jam Plus was in my opinion the best portable bluetooth speaker, but after using this Sharkk BoomBox i can say that the Sharkk is the best portable bluetooth speaker Period.The reason behind this great sound is the fact that this speaker has two main &#34;High frequency&#34; mini speakers and one &#34;low frequency subwoofer&#34; speaker at the back. The two main in the front provide the awesome distortion free vocals while the one in the back is punching the bass. The combination of both the mini speakers and a the subwoofer provided the best music experience in portable speakers.So, the bottom line is go for it you will never regret it
