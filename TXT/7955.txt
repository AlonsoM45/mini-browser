I have tried other Royal Family mochi, and generally have had positive experiences. I really enjoy the Azuki Bean one... This was definitely not the case with the 'green tea' mochi.First they don't taste anything like green tea, I feel like even making the claim is dishonest. The only thing they have in common is that they are slightly colored green, thats it.Secondly and the worst offense of all is that these mochi taste like someone poured a bottle of pungent perfume/soap into the filling. I can't even get the taste off my tongue, I dare say it's not even edible.Into the trash they go.
