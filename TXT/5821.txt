Listen... I've owned over ten headsets besides this one since I initially purchased this one a while back. It has survived most of my 4 year old's life span and he has abused it more than the a public toilet at a buffet during half price hour. I now have a daughter and I have no doubt it will survive her as well.Buy one, and have it in case you are like me and blow through head sets for stupid reasons all the time.
