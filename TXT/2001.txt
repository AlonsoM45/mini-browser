I always believed in Heaven, but I loved Dr. Neal's story of what it was like and I've had signs that I felt had to be imagined and knowing that she had the same doubts makes me realize that it is possible.  I think she explained things in a 'down to earth' (no pun intended) way that made it hard to put the book down.  It is a book that I highly recommend.
