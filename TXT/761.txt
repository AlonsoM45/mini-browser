I got this 3-in-1 Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler to try for free via a program run by Gillette. I was excited to try this styler. I can nicely trim my beard and goatee with this trimmer. It is a breeze with this trimmer. it is the perfect size for me to trim. I get a perfect shape every time. There is one thing I don't like, and that is because the hair clogs up everything and it takes quite a while to clean them, but for a trimmer this great it doesn't bother me too much.  I would defiantly recommend this to everyone who is looking for a great trimmer. I can shave and trim my goatee with out taking another three razors in my hand. I can do it all with one styler.
