I was disappointed in this release.I have been a huge Chrissie Hynde fan since the very first Pretenders album.This record is too pop oriented for my taste,The songwriting collaboration between Chrissie and Bjorn Yitling is much weaker than her previous work.There is even a track with whistling on it similar to the Peter Bjorn and John hit &#34;Young Folks&#34;.The 2 stars are for Chissie's great voice.No one in rock 'n' roll can kick your ass or tear your heart out like Ms. Hynde.Please reform The Pretenders.
