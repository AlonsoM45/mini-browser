This game is original.  It has cool characters and a nice range of attack and weapons.  Starting off you play with two usable characters. One is weaker yet faster, the other is slower yet stronger.  The only thing i have against this game is the fact that the music can be really, really annoying, and the control is a little stiff. Oh, and you'll get stuck in the early quarter of the game.  I still don't know what to do.
