This bag is perfect for my many travels this summer with my little toddler! I search online tillI found this bag; the size is great and its very stylish. However, there it is labeled as &#34;CA prop 65.&#34;I've never purchased anything with this label. The state of California has proved that this productcontains chemicals that cause cancer and fertility issues along with birth defects. Being that I am 7 weekspregnant and plan to use this purse daily, I've decided to return it. Other than that It was perfect for me.Makes me wonder what else should or has this label on it?
