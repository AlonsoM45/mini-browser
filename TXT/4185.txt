This is Ellie Holcomb's first full length album release as a solo artist. Her first two EP's, &#34;Magnolia,&#34; & &#34;With You Now,&#34; were excellent recordings and left me starving for more from this incredible vocalist. Her first two EP's, by the way, are fantastic. Great voice, great worship,  full of Scripture. Why don't &#34;Christian Record Stores,&#34; or &#34;Christian Radio,&#34; play this stuff?! Why? Because it's not full of a  crunchy contemporary sugar coating. There aren't any tired cliches here or boring musical arrangements. Christian radio isn't for everyone I guess. I prefer independent and more obscure artists. And Ellie Holcomb seems to be just that. The first song, &#34;As Sure as the Sun,&#34; starts out with a vocal gently saying, &#34;There is good news...&#34; Amen to that!! This whole album is great and worth the asking price and more. I won't review every song, as you can preview them and form your own opinion. I will continue with the first song though. Ellie sings, &#34;You could never change, no matter what you do. You are loved, more than you know, more than you could hope for, after everything you've done...&#34; This song is a reminder of God's unending mercy. And I need this song. I need to be reminded that God's mercy chases away my wandering heart, which is forever prone to wander!! The rest of this album is just as solid. Full of reminders of who God is and who we are in light of His Word. (If you are familiar with Leslie Phillips, aka Sam Phillips, you will probably enjoy this album, as Ellie's voice is similar in sound.) So if you're still reading this, stop. Buy the record!!
