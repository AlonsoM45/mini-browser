I live in UAE, Abu-Dhabi, and it was such a treat to read about adventures happening next door! I have always read about some other big cities- Paris, New York, Tokyo...But now I was almost a part of an international story, having studied 4 years in Dubai, having friends there and obviously hanging out there ever so often!It is a great sneak-peak of the city's life, showing things which aren't visible for tourists or are hidden from the general society, sometimes too conservative to speak out about problems, which are the same as the rest of the world! I think this book is a great break-though for the Emirati market and an amazing chance for people to see Dubai not only as a luxurious shopping destination, where every mysterious Arab is a Sheikh, but another big city, fighting for a place in the spotlight, with its citizens having their own secrets to share!Great job Ameera! Waiting for your next book! &lt;3
