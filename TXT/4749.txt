I bought this item awhile back and never got to use it because it was untuneable and the strings it comes with were the wrong kind for this type of guitar and when I took it in to get new strings they told me that the bridge was about to snap because of the tension from the strings it comes with. Also the pitch pipe is a piece of plastic trash. I could literally use nothing in this order.I will never buy any other product from this seller, because they lied to us all to get a sale and all we receive is garbage. So don't waste your money here
