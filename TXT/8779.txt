One of the most incredible parts of the film is when one of the SEALS takes a foldable, seemingly toy airlplane from his pack, turns the prop and sends it flying over the enemy.  The airplane, then takes photos of all the buildings and terrain and transmits them back to an Aircraft Carrier, which then directs the strike.
