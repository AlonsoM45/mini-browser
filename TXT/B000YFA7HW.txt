Recently one of our cats had started to show interest in our utility closet. Laying outside the door at night. After the second night, my husband went to investigate and found 2 mice sitting on a hammock in the closet. With me being an animal lover and vegetarian for over 20 yrs, he already knew that there was no way we were going to kill those little guys. I couldn't find any humane traps in the area, so I found this product and decided to try it. We put the traps out and have caught 3 mice in less than 24 hrs. 2 within 30 minutes tonight. I smeared a VERY thin coat (barely visible) of peanut butter in the back of the trap to lure the mice and used banana flavored instant oats for the bait. It worked perfectly! Luckily, we have a park about a mile away where we've released them with some oats. The trap is so simple to use, no need for contact with mice. Negatives to this product are: Its made with very thin plastic, and has small ventilation holes. So they need to be checked often to avoid the mice chewing their way out or suffocating. It is pricey, but well worth it.
