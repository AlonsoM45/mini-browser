I received my case and keyboard cover. I was looking for a deal on both together, and I thought this looked like a good product. Be aware, the case is not crystal clear. There is a frost like quality or opacity to it. The keyboard cover is silver, not clear. However, I do like the silver keyboard, because it blends in nicely with the aluminum of the computer, and gives it a retro feel. Typing will take a bit of getting used to, but it is a good fit. The case fits nice as well, I just wish it was a little more see through. Another note on the keyboard cover- the power button key is painted with the eject symbol, leading me to believe that its for the Macbook Pro, but, again, to me its not a deal breaker. I am very happy with my purchase, and saved a good amount of money over buying a case and keyboard cover in a store.
