Too many table runs cheated out of! Its obvious that the game is designed to let both players shoot 99% of games. The computer would change how far balls would roll and leave you hooked 1-2 balls before the 8 ball. I used a clear ruler to extend my guidelines to the center of pockets and object ball would hit down on rail and then rattle pocket. I understand its supposed to be fun but very unrealistic. Ive been shooting pool everyday for 25 years and I can assure you I dont have to always power the cue ball to draw it back. Also, the way the english works on the game is in no way shape or form realistic. I played to level 18 then uninstalled the game. Just because people are level 78 didnt mean they should be given a chance to shoot because I was a lower level. In real life most people don't get to shoot if I pocket a ball on the break. Someone with some knowledge of the game should have designed it.
