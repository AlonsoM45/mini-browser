My Husband works 12 hour swing shifts, so this bag is plenty big enough to hold all his bottled water, sodas, and Gatorade, and I am talking about the big bottles, and then there is still lots of room left for his meal and snacks and whatever else he needs to take with him. It is well built and sturdy.
