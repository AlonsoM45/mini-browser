Spellbinders are my favorites of all the dies and you'll love them too, specially if you love intricacy in your pattern. The Parisian  dies are super because they are lockable so you can build on your art.  If you purchase any or all you will find they are certainly worth the effort they take to remove them from the paper.  Just remember to use wax paper.
