I bought this for a little girl after seening it on tv. It looked like it was going to be really awsome gift for a 7 year old.... When we started to play with the makeover mirror it was slow and kinda difficult to understand what to do and what all you could do with the product... Over all the 7 years was not excited about this. And I also think it is way over priced!
