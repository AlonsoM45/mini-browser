i guess i should have read a little more on the description, but this kit looked like it had alot of cutting wheels and such, but really only has a few. the main item it has is sanding bits....i don't own a nail salon so i definitely don't need 50 sanding bits. but if that's what you're looking for then i would recommend this kit
