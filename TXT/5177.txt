I've assembled lots of things. I recently just purchased furniture from Ikea. Assembled, no sweat.  This bed is so frustrating to put together it's taken me 3 days b/c I have to get up and walk away from it. Now that it is assembled it is not sturdy. The screws are all very loose b/c of the material that they are embedded in.  It's a cheap bed but I was expecting it to last at least a year. I may toss it before I even use it.
