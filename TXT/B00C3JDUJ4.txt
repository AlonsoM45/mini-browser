3.5 starsI liked this book! :) As you may or may not know, I have a weakness for books/movies about people with elemental powers, so this one belongs on that list too. It wasn't the best ever and sometimes the romance between Ryan and Natalie seemed a bit... rushed. It almost is one of those instant-love thingies you often read in books nowadays. And I'm not really a fan of that. But overall this was a fun book and I liked it. I really did. And I would read the sequel because I want to know what happens next.ARC courtesy of the author.
