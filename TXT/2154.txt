This Is A Very Neat Tactical Vest, &#34;A Best Buy For Sure&#34;,  you will have to look very hard, and spend a lot more money to find a better vest that this one, but while the vest is great, and adjust to about a 2XL size, the belt that comes with the vest is also of good quality, but the belt's waist size fit is only about 42&#34; to maybe 44&#34; at max.  Again this tactical vest is a best buy, and made/sewn very well.JM
