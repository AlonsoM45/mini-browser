I was very excited when i forst got this coat. It looks very good and is very comfortable. Then i found out one of the pocket buttons was mis-aligned when it was pressed onto the jacket, and there is no way to fix it due to the broke off piece being stitched inside the lining if the pocket. Also, after 2 weeks of light - moderate use, this coat is already falling apart. Threads are coming loose all over the jacket, and i will haft to get my Gma to fix some of the inner-liner buttons that were very poorly stitched on with loose threads. I would not recommend this coat to anyone. Ive heard so much about Rothco. Well i tell ya, my experience with them sucks so far. Stay away from this coat no matter how cool it looks.
