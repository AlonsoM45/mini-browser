It wasn't too long ago when I found about baoding balls, so I was just buying random ones and trying them out.  These are pretty lightweight and come with a beautiful-sounding chime.  They're pretty easy to work with, even for a beginner like me (okay, the tiny ones I had were more difficult to work with than these).  It won't be long until I start working with heavier, or bigger ones.  But I got these, multiples, to work with over time.  The designs on these are really beautiful, and so far they haven't worn out or anything.  I definitely recommend these to the beginners who want to work with something light.  If you don't like listening to chimes, then I suggest you opt out of this one.
