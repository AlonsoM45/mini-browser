The print and binding are excellent and it ever retains that odd Japanese book store smell similar to bamboo and/or a tatami mat; however, the content contains mostly Toho and Daiei monsters from the 1970's.  Strangely, this book has a Godzilla paper cut out which would make it a good child's book.  Also, the latter third of the book is devoted to fan art which appears to be drawn by child.  A very curious book indeed, but not for any serious fan of past and present Dai Kaiju movies.
