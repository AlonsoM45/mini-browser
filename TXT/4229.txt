I would rate this app higher, but there is always problems when you have to update. The game updated to the Valentine's quest and now it messes up. It loads then after less than a minute it re loads. It just keeps on doing this no matter how many times you restart it. There is just so many days to complete this quest, but can't play to do it. Please fix this newest problem.
