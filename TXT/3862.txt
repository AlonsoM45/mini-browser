I am soo delighted with this electric broom.It has great power. I like the swivel head , not too noisy. The dirt cup could be a little bigger so I empty it every time I use it.No big deal.Nice long cord.Don't hesitate too buy.It's definitely worth the price.Thanks Hoover I was worried I would have to spend a fortune for something with quality. Great buy
