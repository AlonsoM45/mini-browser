This case is really perfrct for any Daryl Dixon fan with an iPhone 4. I have had this case since before Christmas and it has been through it's fair share of drops, but the case has always held firm. There is not a single crack or scratch to be seen and, although it's a thin case, it has protected my iphone wonderfully.The one semi-negative thing I have to say about the case is it is a tad duller in color than its picture, however, it still looks very nice and I have no real qualms about the coloring. I am definitely happy with my purchase.
