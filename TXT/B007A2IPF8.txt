I like games that aren't too easy. This one is definitely not too easy. It's also got a nice mix of games. My biggest problem with it is that it keeps wanting you to advertise for them in facebook. I don't go on Facebook and definitely don't want to let everyone know all my guilty pleasures. I wish that like sound effects there was a button so you could turn this off. Also, game lost the star because it asked me after every chapter to leave a review. If I like your game I won't need to be asked to review it. This should b knocked back to every fourth or fifth level. I didn't hit the don't ask again because I intended to leave one....so fix your game so it stops pestering people.
