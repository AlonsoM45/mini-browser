My daughter loves this duck! She is 7 months and wants her duckie at all baths. It's cute and small. It doesn't sit upright , but it spends the bath in her mouth anyhow.  Be careful because it will get water in it- squeeze out the duck after each bath to avoid any issues.  Not made in china , hooray
