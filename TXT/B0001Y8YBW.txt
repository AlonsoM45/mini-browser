I had ordered the wrong size several times as I was getting the shoes as a gift. The service was great and I was able to change my order without jeopardizing the time the shoes came in. They worked with me every step of the way! I'd buy again for sure and would highly recommend the product. After a month the shoes are still looking great and being enjoyed.
