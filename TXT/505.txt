I first purchased this shoe in navy. It was so incredibly comfortable, and looked amazing with ankle-length pants, that I HAD to purchase the red as well.  Just be careful of the patent - covered heel. Once the back catches on something and the heel gets scraped, there is no way to touch it up or fix it.
