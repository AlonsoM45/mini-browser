Like every parent (so I believe) I look for practical advice - based on the experience of other parents, preferably those with professional knowledge.From the beginning I liked the H.H (Happy - Healthy) boundaries - managing the situation in a way that will obey the H.H principles. This was the first place I had to look myself in the mirror and admit that I don't always act in such a way... what can I say? This realization disarmed me! Made me open and receptive and strengthen my understanding that I need to change something in the way I manage daily situations with my kids.In a nutshell, this book opened my eyes and equipped me with great ideas. As my title says, I've already solved two ongoing issues.I think this book is a must read for every parent.
