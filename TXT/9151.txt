I am writing this review so that no one will make the same mistake that I did. I bought this poster a few weeks ago. I was very disappointed. It arrived very quickly in about 4 days, however, the quality of the poster is horrible! Nothing like the image shown! The paper it was printed on was very flimsy and cheap. The colors were so off! It looked NOTHING like the image shown!!! Their customer support is horrible! They NEVER responded any of my emails and messages. I am still waiting for a response! I was not even able to return it! It was like I simply just threw my $10 in the trash! This poster is not even worth a dollar! Horrible horrible quality and horrible customer support. I hope that no one will buy this poster and make the same mistake that I did!
