This is a great jacket, but 3 stars because I recieved the Mighty Lite II as opposed to the current model, the Mighty Lite III, listed here. Have tried all incarnations of this jacket and the subtle design tweaks in the Mighty Lite III made for an improved fit for me. Previous models were oddly narrow at the top of the sleeve, with uncomfortable seams in the pit area. My arms and shoulders are not big. I'm 5'5, 130, and a small in the Mighty Lite III is a more comfortable fit for wear with light or no layers vs. the previous models. That being said, I had to send the Mighty Lite II back and get the III directly from Columbia. Dissapointing to pay full price for an older model, when you can spend the same on the current updated version... which is what I thought I was getting here. Someone dropped the ball! Great jacket with great features, though. Figure flattering. Great as a mid-layer when it's very cold. Love the thumb-hole cuffs! Worth the trouble to get the right one.
