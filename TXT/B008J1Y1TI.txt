The Satin Booty Shorts state that they are One Size and they are far from One Size! I usually wear a juniors size 7 or 9 and was unable to wear these shorts. They have very little give in the waist area and they had a very long crotch area making them very unflattering. I was very excited to get these shorts but was very disappointed in their fit, I have sent them back because I would never feel sexy wearing them!
