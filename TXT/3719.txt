Have had this for months in use even through the past cold winter misery we had in the south and still works. Takes good pictures and battery life is longer than that of some other brands. I wrote to moultrie because of worry of cold temps and operation range and the info they gave me said it would work and it did, the rayovac batteries i had in it didn't die as well! overall for low budget this worked good.
