I only started reading a year ago and fell in love with the bet....It's hard to find a sequal just as good if not better. I found myself crying, LOL, and couldn't wait to find out what was next. Its nice to have a different story then all the other books and keep your interested without a cliffhanger! ! You will not be disappointed .
