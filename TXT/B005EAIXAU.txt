These are a great tool to have on your person at all times. You may not use it for months, but when you need it and it's right there, you'll be super glad you had it.These are higher quality than others I've had. They came in a timely fashion. The packing was a bit primitive,  but didn't affect my opinion of the product. If you're wanting to buy with the intention of selling, or having stocking stuffers/random prizes for campers, or whatnot,  you can buy 100 pc. lots and get much better deals per piece if you buy from another source online. But , if a few are enough, buy here!
