I got nearly nothing but positive things to say about MLP:FiM. The only down part is when season 3 ended Lauren Said &#34;That's not the direction I would have taken the show&#34;. So That's always made me wonder how she would have done it. And what if (hypothetically speaking) when she left the show, Hasbro said dnt worry you gave us a winner a sure money maker we'll fill your pockets. I can only imagine that to her it wasn't about the money not even close
