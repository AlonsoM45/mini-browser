This rice cooker is perfect for our little family of 3.I was looking for a smaller zojirushi rice cooker, i had the zojirushi neuro fuzzy 10-cups rice cooker and it was huge.At first the non stick coating on my neuro fuzzy was starting to peel off and i needed a replacement pan.There's none available, even on zojirushi's website. The replacement pan was about $50+shipping.So when amazon had this no-fuss zojirushi rice cooker on sale for less than 50 bucks, i jumped on the deal.I keep the fancy neuro fuzzy in the basement now, and my new rice cooker is just perfect.
