Ordered a set of dumbbells (yes, plural, that's what the product page says)  only to find out that it contains only 1 handle (after re-reading the product page it actually says &#34;contains one handles&#34;. Why would I buy a 60 pounds set of dumbbells only to use 1 handle ?  Read product page  carefully before committing.
