The overall design of the mouse is great. It feels very good in your hand and the laser is very precise. Now what I didn't like about it is the weight and the lights. This mouse is noticeably heavier than all the previous mouses that I have owned, which makes it harder to pick up and move but you eventually get used to it. The main reason i gave this mouse a 3 star rating is for the software. It comes with a CD that has the driver for the lights and other settings in the box, but you need to change the name of certain files so that your computer can recognize them because they are originally in Chinese. Another option is to download the drivers in English from Overload Forums, which you have to make an account to get permission to download it. Once you finally get the driver installed, it doesn't even work! The only setting for the lights that does work is the one that cycles through all the colors, which I believe is the &#34;demo&#34; mode. I wanted to change it to solid blue to match my case, but that is not longer an option. Overall, it is a good mouse, but if you are crazy about the lights and being able to adjust setting on the mouse, there are much better mouses out there for this price.
