I read this on my son's recommendation and it was great read. So well written, thought provoking, sometimes poetic. Rings of truth in the portrayal of parents left to survive vs the children waiting to die. Touching on the dual existence of individual beliefs with an universal need to seek and give comfort. Tells the story without dragging it out; letting the ending quietly linger.
