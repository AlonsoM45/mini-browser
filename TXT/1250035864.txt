This should be everybody's go to when trying to lose weight. If you have to kick your metabolism in to gear I swear this is the only thing out there that actually works. Dr. Ian did it with this diet plan. I actually didn't lose much weight on it because I could not follow it myself. Its actually not hard to follow but in my home I live with the pickiest eaters in the world. My hubby and kids refused to eat the dinners I made so then I couldn't follow the plan and I was not making 2 different meals at dinner , that's a waste of time. Also I had trouble eating breakfast everyday I don't have time to cook eggs and the other stuff. But I tried to stick to it as much as possible and it does work because I had tons of energy. One day when my kids are older I pull the book out an try it again. It just doesn't fit into my lifestyle right now. But if you don't have the problems I have , it will work for you.
