I highly recommend this driver side power non-heated mirror. It fits exactly as the original mirror that came with the Nissan Sentra SL car. I took the silver colored lid off the original mirror from Nissan and slipped it on to this new mirror because it came in black, and it was a perfect fit. Also, I saved about $100 by ordering it from Amazon. I am thrilled!!!
