I was searching through Amazon looking for a new case because I was tired of my old Otterbox that was getting washed up. I stumbled upon this one and thought it would be a great fit. It came in the mail in about 5 days and I was excited to start using it.At first I was very pleased with the case. It looked sleek and it was protective. I got the navy blue matte finish one for the iPhone 4. The adapter hole to charge the phone was a little to small. The adapter would fit but it would fall out if you were using the phone which became frustrating really fast. But the major problem was that the corners of the matte finish on the back of the case started to peel off. This started about two weeks after I started to use it.
