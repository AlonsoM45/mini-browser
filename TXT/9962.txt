I am a big fan of Steven King. Read almost all of his books. I read the shining and saw the movie.I enjoyed the book. I realize now that when Mr. King was younger he suffered from alcoholism, and this addiction gave him the ability to write some seriously out there novels. He is sober now, and so is the craziness.The book gave closure to Danny Torrence, but alcoholism and it's negative affects was part of the theme. The book was not as out there because the craziness of alcoholism is now in check.I wish Mr. King continued sobriety, and thank him for the numerous books I devoured through the years. I am sure it was not easy....,
