xmas gift for my 3 year old who got his first game system a wii! I was very skeptical about it being too hard but I wanted to encourage the physical movement. We live in a crappy area so I don't take him out much unless its far from here. So I wanted something that could get him playing and moving without going to the local parks! Great buy Its really easy for him! He loves all the characters even though hes not into tv he started to like them with this game! Hes really into books so I didn't think he would like this but he really loves it and he plays for about 30 minutes a day with me! (It really is a workout lol) Great for parents and kids to do together!
