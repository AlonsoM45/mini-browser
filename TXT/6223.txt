This was such a help to me this year.  I had a major illness and could not really face trying to get out to shop.  I was able to get these for family members who live a good distance away, which would have meant shopping AND shipping.  The grandkids loved them and there were plenty of items available for the parents as well.  Even better, I could deliver them via Face Book, which worked better than I ever imagined.  Great service and great idea that sure worked for me this year.
