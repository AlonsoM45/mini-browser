Recently I was interested in playing a few classic Nintendo games and I saw this, andI love the look of the console itself, eeminds me of the famicom. Anyway, let me get into some pros and cons of the console.Pros:-Compatible wih almost the entire NES library (only a dozen or so games dont work)-Very cheap in comparison to the original NES & NES toploader-It looks good, not as good as an original Nintendo, but still good-The 2 packaged in controllers are nice, they aren't pretty, but they feel decent and have good features-You can use original NES controllers, because it has the standard NES port-The console feels sturdy, but is very lightCons:-The plastic feels cheap, but it's not horrible by any means-A few games aren't compatible-The console is really light and that bothers me, I like hefty videogame consoles, you feel like youre buying something with more qualityOverall the console is a nice alternative to buying a Nintendo. You'll save a bit of cash and if you get some official Nintendo controllers or some nice 3rd party controllers then the experience shouldn't be any different from playing an original NES.4/5
