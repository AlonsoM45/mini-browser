I was very happy with these protein bars and they contain 30 g of high quality absorbable protein and have a hearty amount of calories to get your day started on the right foot and keep you satisfied longer than other bars that I have had. I am a very active athlete and these are perfect. The sweet potato/pumpkin combo has great taste. I will definitely be ordering again. They came earlier than expected!!  :)
