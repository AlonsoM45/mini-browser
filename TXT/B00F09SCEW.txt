Since I ordered it for only $25, I'm not too concerned about the small issues with it. The cups run a size small, so I ordered a 28GG, which is one size up from what I wear in the Lucy and Marcie. It's the correct size, and it fits fairly well. However, I dislike how thick and stiff the padding is. It's similar to the Freya Deco, padding wise. It also gives a slightly more wide front profile than the Lucy or Marcie. It makes my boobs appear a bit larger than they are, which isn't something that I look for in a bra. Despite the little problems with it, it's a nice basic and will be great for spring and summer .
