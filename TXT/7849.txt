I started reading this and figured it would be pretty much the same as all of the others I've read recently (all of which I ended up loving in one sense or another).  But as I kept reading, I loved this even more.  I had fear throughout that I would end up in tears, and that they wouldn't be sappy happy ones.  Just as I'd predicted, I read the last few pages, tears running down my cheeks.  This is definitely worth reading, especially for someone who not only enjoys a good love story, but also for anyone that believes that miracles can and do happen.
