we gave this to my son for his first birthday, the big one, and he seems to really like it. he is learning  that if he hits the  hands it will make noise an  he LOVES music. he dances with it and likes to hit it a lot. I think it's great for little kids. it has been dropped on tile a few times an stomped on by a 4year old and it still works fine. we haven't tried the rolling feature yet though.
