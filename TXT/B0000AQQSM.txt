I was skeptical of the product actually working but after the first use the top side of my 2001 Sea Ray looked 100% better. I applied two more applications and the shine and sheen of the top side of the boat looks like brand new. Used in conjunction with the Pro Polish I can actually see my reflection in the gel coat. I would highly recommend for heavily oxidized boats!
