Product is as described and fits properly.  Just make sure you take the time to look at the size chart so you get the correct size.  There are no pockets for your hands as you might expect on a Levis denim jacket.  But for the price, the denim jacket looks good and quality seems to be decent as well.  I would recommend this if you can do without pockets for your hands.  The 2 chest pockets are real pockets however.  For this price, it's a good purchase.
