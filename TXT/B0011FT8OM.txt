This has been a godsend for me. I suffered from chronic UTI's. I would finish a round of antibiotics and within a week or two my symptoms would come back. It was horrible. I started taking this and within a week I could tell the difference, no pressure no irritation, no urgency. For those that suffer from chronic UTI's you know what I am talking about. I have gone 2 months free of any UTI symptoms even if I don't drink as much water as I should some days (that sometimes was a trigger for my UTI's couldn't even leave the house without a few bottles of water in my bag) I will always make sure I have a bottle of this on hand. If you suffer from UTI's this is definitely worth a shot. I am happy that I did.
