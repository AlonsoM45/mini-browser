Fits my note 2 good and does not slide off too easily and snugs it just right. Sometimes lint may stick to it &#34;but that is because it is rubber like&#34;. overall with the skin on it i can dock it in my desktop dock that has pen holder style with no issues. Also gives good gripping surface while using brodit. Overall a good cheap purchase that beats the crap out of a folder or hard plastic type case.
