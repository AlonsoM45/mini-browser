The quality seems pretty good. I ordered two of these for my sons outdoor birthday party to make it easier which it did come in handy so the wind didn't blow the roll. As far as making it easier to pull the paper towel off with one hand I'm not so sure about. At first it seemed to work pretty well. But overall I'm satisfied with them and use them a lot over the summer outside for our cookouts.
