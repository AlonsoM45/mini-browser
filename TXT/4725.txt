This game is just incredible, and a must-have for SMT fans. It's a turn-based strategy JRPG, and a good one at that. The atmosphere is just the right amount of creepy and incredibly intriguing. Played the persona games but not sure if you'll like the other SMT stuff? Give this a shot, you won't be disappointed C:
