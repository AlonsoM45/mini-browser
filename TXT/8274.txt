No way to adjust the reticle brightness, is ok in low light but in sunlight it is so bright that it washes out the target and leaves ghost images on your retina,, not good for outdoors during the day, might be ok for home defense, but with no on-off switch your battery might be dead when you hear something go bump in the night.. I would skip it.
