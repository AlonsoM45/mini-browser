When i got this i installed the cd that came with it and it would not work well with some looking around at the installed device it wasnt even an easycap it was a smi grabber witch is the fake version of easycap so the audio doesnt work and the video sucks but i wasnt going to fight the guy i got it from because it was cheap and i didnt want to wait another 4 weeks to get it and hope it would get here some day
