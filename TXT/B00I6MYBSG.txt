I enjoyed the story very  much, but felt like it ended too soon. I think she could have written more since it is a short book. I'd love to read how the story continued after the blessings. How did each grow after the baby came?It is an encouraging story of hope and of reaching out beyond yourself.Mrs. Patrick Welsh
