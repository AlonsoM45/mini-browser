shipping took a bit longer than expected though i bought a used one. I have never owned a Dyson or a similar in price vacuum, the reviews i read stated that this one has stronger suction. My parents bought a vacuum that needed a small loan to buy and I can tell this one is better. More importantly I don't feel like I'm going into battle carrying around all the attachments with this. Even the hose has a better and more controlled suction.
