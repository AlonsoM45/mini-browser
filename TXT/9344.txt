Great style and color! Very very comfortable.  My son's favorite shoes so far!  His current pair is 10.5 and I tried to find him an 11.5 on Amazon without success.  When I found a pair 13XW, I ordered it right away (save it for future).We have tried other styles with straps in XW but none of them is comparable with this one. They are all XW, but not as wide as this one and the archs are not as high as this one.  Wish NB could bring this style back!!!
