I was gifted this book for a honest review. This book is one of the best that I have read in a really long time or I should say since Lynn Reds last one. It is a great book it has a big cuddle bear a great heroine put it all together with a really good story line and WOW. It is a must read for shifter fans. Loved the story cannot wait until the next one comes out. It was so good that I also bought it to support the author.
