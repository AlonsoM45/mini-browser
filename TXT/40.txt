The author has been there and done that when it comes to what he suggests. He was an Air Force SERE ( Survival Evasion Resistance Escape ) instructor for 30 years. His approach to the subject of survival is practical in that he does NOT approach the topic with primitive tool making or cutting trees down to make a shelter. His approach is quick, practical and effective. I highly recommend this book!
