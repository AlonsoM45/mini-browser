I am thrilled to give Some Swamis are Fat five stars! I was continually impressed with Ava Green's big scope - she goes to the spiritual left, always holding the big picture, with possibility and kindness. She off-handedly zings into what's universally correct with writing that's loony and sensible at the same time. You wind up with an authenticity and warmth that befriend you to the book.
