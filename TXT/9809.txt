I saw that my buddy had this boost case for his phone and thought it was nice. After asking him about the charging times and how it works I was sold. I use my phone quite a bit to remotely enter in data to complete my service calls when in the field. This case keeps my phones battery % untouched & remaining @100% the majority of the day. (Again I use my phone A LOT)Buy it, DO IT
