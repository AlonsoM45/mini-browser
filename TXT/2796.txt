What more is there to say. These rims look awesome on my slash. They do add a little extra weight compared to the stock plastic rims but the ability to change tires in a matter of minutes is worth the weight. I found it a little difficult at first to get the tires evenly balanced but realized while trying I could have been driving off road with my newly bolted on mud slinger tires. Another great buy and a perfect addition to these great rims.(Two hex screws shown but it does of course come with all 6.)
