I'm giving this item 3 stars because I do love this type of organization. Unfortunately, as soon as I got the package delivered I put it to use in my diaper bag, when I pulled them out (still the first day of having it) to show my husband, one of the tabs that hold the hook to the mesh pouch completely tore off &#128544; (so the hook was clipped to the ring without the pouch). I didn't overpack it at all. I didn't want to go through the hassle of taking everything out and returning it, so I'm just thinking of keeping it (I will contact the seller to see if they'll send me one replacement pouch, if possible... If not, then I will return it). I think it's a bit overpriced for something like this to happen.
