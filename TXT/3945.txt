After product started getting air pockets for no apparent reason, I contacted Spigen thinking by them being a &#34;High End Product&#34; that they would replace their expensive product with no problem.. Man was I wrong!! They wanted so much &#34;Proof Of Purchase&#34; and after I sent them pictures and Amazon purchase # they still wouldn't replace my EXPENSIVE screen protector!! So They Will Never Get My Money Again and I Have 3 Iphones and A Samsung Galaxy 3 that i'm always buying screen protectors for but NEVER FROM SPIGEN AGAIN!!!! Maybe they just treated me like that, I don't know, but it won't happen again!!! Signed, Lost Customer for good!!!
