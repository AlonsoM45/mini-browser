These are my first pair of compression socks.  I am using them to reduce swolling in a fractured leg.  I love the fact that the material is so nice, they look just like very nice trouser socks. They feel awesome on.  They are new and shipped quickly.  Follow the instructions for size.  I based it on the shoe size as suggested and was glad I did, despite the fact that I have very tiny legs.
