Speedy service! I bought theis when I worked in residential care for misguided youth. I used this as a tool to teach classes and it was something that they found very relatable. I now work in the community with many of the same youth and still use this as a tool or just something to show them. Thanks for being so quick on delivery as well! I recommend this movie/book to any and all who work with youth!
