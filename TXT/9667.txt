When I first opened the box and saw the product, I was disappointed because it was flat, which on the internet, it looked like it had dimension; however, when I lifted it off of the styrofoam and saw that it had pegs to keep it away from the wall, I was more optimistic.  Once I hung it on the wall (which was very easy to hang), I was totally thrilled with it.  It is beautiful and definitely looks three dimensional.  It is worth the money I spent on it and I highly recommend it as it is a beautiful piece of artwork.Sincerely,Nancy
