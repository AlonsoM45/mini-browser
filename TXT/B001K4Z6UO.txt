I have a pair of bike shorts that are too snug around the thigh even though they are a Lg,( I am a  size 14) I ordered these in a large because of the reviews stating they were generous and they fit just great!  I wear them under my regular yoga capries or shorts and I love the flexibility of using clothing I am comfortable in.  The padding works for my 10 mi or less trips, don't know if there is enough for the longer rides yet.
