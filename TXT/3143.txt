I downloaded the free version from here (which turned out to be an older version); after the program updated itself through the developers' site, I found that even though it's nowhere close to Microsoft Office (it won't even change fonts like the online user's guide shows, nor will it let me print anything for some reason) the interface is decent and there's not a lot of clutter on the screen. The main problem I found is that to have the truest professional version of this program you have to  BUY the Windows-compatible suite (at 50 or roughly $120!) Let's face it, shall we? If we wanted to spend that kind of money, we wouldn't be looking at freeware, now would we?
