Very good product. Much better than the Santa Medical one we purchased first and had to throw out because it gobbled up batteries. The Nonin has same battery now for over 6 weeks. Accuracy matches the professional units used by the nurses at rehab center. Thinking of buying another one for another member of the family. Do not hesitate because of price - it is clearly the best on the market.
