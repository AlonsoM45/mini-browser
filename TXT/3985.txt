I will be completely honest... chapter 1 really lost me. I was not into the idea of a teenage love story, so I put the book away and decided not to read it. A few days later I saw a YouTube video of Teri telling her story about writing the book and where the story is headed. (YouTube link here [...] The video made me very curious, so I picked the book back up and dove right into chapter 2. From there I read chapters 2-14 without hardly breathing, I was so excited! I absolutely loved where the book went, and I am ecstatic anticipating the next books! Good job Teri!
