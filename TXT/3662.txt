It suds up good, i used this in an attached sprayer bottle on my hose and it foamed up good spraying it out. Noticed after rinsing it immediately started beading water off which is a good sign. Only time will tell on how long it will last. As far as cleaning power it does fairly good, but i've seen better. Then again it is trying to do two jobs in one. The best cleaning of a car is in steps, but for an all in one cleaner and wax i think this outperforms most.
