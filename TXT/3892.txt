I love this game! I thought at first that it would be much like it's sister game "Diner Dash", which I also like, but Wedding Dash not only has the character Flo from Diner Dash, and the similarities of having to bring guests their meals quickly, but also the bonuses of getting different guests with their own personalities and preferences. Though this adds its own extra challenges to the levels, which increase in difficulty as you go on, it also personally makes the game more interesting and enjoyable! I've spent many an hour attempting to not only reach the goals needed to pass each level, but also to pass the "expert" goal. The free trial gives free levels in one venue, while additional payments unlock different wedding venues. Very addicting and fun game.
