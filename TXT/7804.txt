This game is quite innovative in that it combines multiple genres including a variation of the point and click detective adventure, grand theft auto, and the Phoenix Wright-like choice dialogue system. The main issue I had with this game is that despite the great job with facial features, tone, and what not, that give you clues as to what you need to say. Throughout the game you are supposed to use these human features to determine if they are telling the truth, lying, or if you should doubt them about a piece of testimony. It can really be random, kind of like in Phoenix Wright games where the dialogue does not make clear at times to what you need to do, especially since human aspects that indicate you should pick lie, or pick doubt, are quite similar. Luckily, if you are a perfectionist, there are plenty of guides. However, this is the type of game you really can't enjoy the first time unless you don't use one. Another thing, and this is for the xbox 360 version of the game, before you buy, you should know that the game is 3 discs due to hd dvd's terrible storage capacity.
