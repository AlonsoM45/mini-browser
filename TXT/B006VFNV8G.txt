In my opinion any game without PERMISSIONS is worth looking into. I happen to love word games and have some of this companies other word games. This game is very fun. Some of their groupings made me pause, but they did make sense, just remember they don't always go with  the most obvious answer. So far halloween is my favorite but Valentine's is easiest. Take a chance with this FAOTD, YOU will have fun
