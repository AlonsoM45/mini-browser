I put this on my LG phone and at first I thought it would be  another cheap phone case but it looks durable and nice. when I got it I snapped it on and I don't have any complaints. I can take it off without braking it. plus I have a one year old that loves to throw it, drop it, and eat it. it has protected my phone  an  the case hasn't come off from any of those things. very happy with this product.
