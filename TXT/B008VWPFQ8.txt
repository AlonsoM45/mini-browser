I am really disappointed in this product. It arrived utterly damaged. The decals/paint on the beads had mostly rubbed off and stuck to everything else (the tree base, other beads, everything), making a huge mess. Not only that, but it doesnt seem well-suited for a child to play with at all. Needless to say, I will be sending it back.
