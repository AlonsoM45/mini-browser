To say that I was disappointed in this product is an understatement. I'm 5'4&#34;, 140 pounds. I'm healthy but I do have curves. These boots would not zip up! I've never had a pair of boots even be tight on my calves before, but these were ridiculous. As soon as I can figure out how to return them form my money back, I will be doing that.Don't buy these unless your legs are VERY thin.
