What can I say about it... it&#699;s a basic belt.  It fits, it works, and I like it. Nothing fancy, just a belt to hold up my fatigues or tactical pants.... and I can hang my sidearm holster, and a couple of mags on it as well.  I wanted something low profile, because if I wear a battle belt over it, I didn&#699;t want a big buckle on my pants as well as a cobra buckle on the battle belt.  This is great for what it is.  I gave it 4 stars only because I don&#699;t actually LOVE IT... but I like it alot and it serves its intended purpose well. Buy it.
