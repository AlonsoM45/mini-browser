I honestly love this bouncer, my feet can tell you otherwise... It definetly will not flop over because of the wide base. I've tripped many times with the base of it since it really sticks out. Other than some jammed toes, my daughter really seems to enjoy it, I would recommend buying! It's easy to assemble and the material can be quickly removed for a wash.
