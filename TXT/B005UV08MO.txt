I have used the NB811 shoes for years. it is now discontinued. I read the review of the new 812, and decided to change.Since I use a custom insert  in both the left and right shoe, i took a gamble that this would work. The stride is more lively then the 811, the support is as good, but my feet feel warmer( i live in Florida) when I am just sitting around. They are Not made in the U.S.A. I think once I get used to the difference that they will be fine for the live of the shoe.
