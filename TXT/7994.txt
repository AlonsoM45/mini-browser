There are SO MANY reviews on these headphones, and you&#699;ll get all kinds of technical reviews.  But here&#699;s my take:These are good.  There are a few people who say they&#699;re better than Beats...I don&#699;t know about that.  My Beats are great and these are close but not quite. IMHO. Keep in mind, these are &#34;Extra Bass&#34; headphones.  So the bass frequencies are going to have a lot more presence due to the fact that these are tuned that way.  So... don&#699;t expect them to have a flat EQ response across the board.  They&#699;re GOOD, and for $39 bucks...that&#699;s GREAT!  So they get 5 stars for that reason.Let me also say this: I&#699;ve got a pretty big dome.  My fitted cap size is 7-3/4.  Yea Yea Yea...I know.  BUT, I wanted a set of headphones that wouldn&#699;t squeeze my head, or a set that I didn&#699;t have to open them to their farthest most position to wear them.  These... 2-3 clicks on each side, and I&#699;m good.  Oh...and that was a nice touch too.  The little &#34;clicks&#34; so you can be sure they&#699;re even on both sides.IF you&#699;re someone that doesn&#699;t like bass... then don&#699;t get these.  You&#699;ll be tweaking your EQ all day, every day.  I personally like the deeper freq response.  And what I did was set my EQ flat from the lowest freq&#699;s, and then a little higher on the high freq&#699;s.I would recommend this buy to anyone with a big size noggin&#699; looking for headphones that don&#699;t squeeze or pinch your head.
