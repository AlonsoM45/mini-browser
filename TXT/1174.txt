This was my 9 year old son's Christmas present. I priced them at the music stores.  They were very expensive.  This one was a good price.  It came just before Christmas and packaged nicely.  It doesn't take up a lot of room.  The guitars (3 different sizes)don't fall out...which is a good thing  :-)  I would highly recommend it!
