This sucker was hard to put together (I seriously put the crib together much faster). It seems as though the pieces were too tight (I think I still have 2 screws that weren't put in, because there was no possible way to screw it in (in some places). My baby only used it the first 6 weeks (I know it's meant for the first few weeks), but if you're looking into a bassinet (buy one that is a playpen) it would be a smart buy!
