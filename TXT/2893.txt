When I received this cross  the first thing I noticed was the detail, it is beautiful! The size and weight are perfect. One of the reviews I read noted that the back of the cross was &#34;hollow&#34;, I would say it was designed that way so the cross would not be to heavy and it would not be able to be showcased on the delicate yet sturdy chain that it came on. The cross is a nice solid piece...I love it!!
