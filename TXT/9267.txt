The suit arrived earlier than I was expecting it, so I got to wear it for the two costume parties I went to! It was a nearly perfect fit, except for the too-big arms, but I had them fixed in just a few hours. If you're in between sizes, definitely get the smaller one. The fabric is really comfortable, and I got a lot of compliments on how it looked on me. I wore it as Anne Hathaway's version of Catwoman in "Dark Knight Rises," by the way, and everyone thought I looked very similar to the character. One thing though: be careful with the fragile zipper!
