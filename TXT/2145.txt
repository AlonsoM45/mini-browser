I really like this 12 ga shotgun ammo pouch, it will allow you to carry 10 shells on your regular belt, or it can be attached to your molle type combat ammo vest, or other combat type ammo belts/vest. it's very compact, and holds the 12 ga shells well.  Buy several of these 12 ga ammo pouches, so if, or when the "Zombies" come you'll be ready".JM
