This screen protector is great!  The protector is slick and it doesn't change the way your screen feels after you've applied the screen protector.  I'm not a fan of the matte, non glare screen protector because it takes away from the slick feel of the glass.  I can deal with the glare if the screen protector feels like the glass, and it does.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a screen protector and isn't looking for the non glare protectors.  You can't beat this product for the price.
