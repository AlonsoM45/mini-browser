The rear window visibility of my smart fortwo convertible was a bit claustrophobic. I looked into a lot of aftermarket backup camera solutions and stumbled upon this. Buying the 11&#34; x 14&#34; size, I cut it in half horizontally, flipped the top half upside down and stuck it to the bottom of the back window. It now completely obsoletes both side mirrors; it is dramatically wider in both directions and leaving virtually no blind spot. The fortwo is the perfect car for this product because the rear window has very little slant and no ass-end sticking out, so there is neither distortion nor obstruction. Because I left a gap in the top of the window, I can still tell when a car is very close to me.Twelve bucks and no hassle, you can't go wrong with this.I'm also recommending it for the hospital I work at, it makes it much easier for staff to check on patients. Doors with a 1'x1' view port can have this stuck to it and you can see everyone in the room at a glance.
