Im so happy so very happy. Wonderful colors. Have the original white turbie twist, and finally treated myself to something i use all the time. Missed it immensely on my cruise and vacation, had forgotten it at home. Now one will stay in my suitcase as a reminder, and will refresh it, just before vacation. Never want to be without it again. My hair is long, and those Hotel/Cruise ship towels, are either TOO big or TOO tiny, to wrap up all my hair in, could not find one anywhere on the cruise for sale or on any of the side trips. HIGHLY Recommend for anyone in the hospital or nursing home, great to wrap up your hair in, so light and absorbent.
