I'm 5'4&#34; and 140lbs. I am curvy, so I bought a large. In hindsight, I would have been fine with a medium. My bust is really large but my waist is rather small so I usually have a really hard time finding costumes that fit correctly and don't make me look like a complete prostitute. I was really quite pleased with this costume. It came on time and in really good condition. My only real complaints were that the belt was WAY too large (but with two safety pins it was a super easy fix) and the boot covers would not stay fastened (but I ended up just tying the straps together and didn't have any more issues).All in all, this costume was a huge hit and suited my needs perfectly. I highly recommend!
