I was very satisfied with this durable jewelry holder. It works very well for size 14G jewelry. I have all my jewelry neatly organized and now I don't have to go through the frustrations of losing my body jewelry. I use this for navel rings and it securely holds all the barbells in place. I am very satisfied with this product and I do plan on ordering from this company again.
