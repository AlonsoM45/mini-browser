First of all, it is not illegal under BATFE rules to have this conversion as long as this conversion is done by a certified gun smith; the proper tax stamps and paperwork filled out. Just make sure that you also ensure that it isn't against your state law in owning a weapon like this.For you newbies out there, if you want a full auto weapon, the SKS is not the way to go, and you shouldn't be trying something like this anyway. If you screw it up, you will have a runaway (weapon fires on full auto without trigger compressed) this can lead to serious consequences for you or some innocent bystander. If you want full auto weapons, then look into the AK47, Galil, M-4 Carbine or LAR-47, these weapons were designed to operate under these conditions and need no conversions, just a background check and a lot of money.Don't be the retard that gets the pretty silver braclets for going about it the wrong way.
