An interesting read. Definitely one and done for me. Leaf is the most messed up protagonist I had the pleasure of reading about, through his &#34;God's Eyes&#34;. So, it was comical at times, strange mostly, and to be honest, I bought this book because Satan Burger is something I would have come up with for the title. So I connected on that level. Many times it was just strange as hell and gave me weird feelings b.c it's just such a strange story. The images this book puts in your mind is pretty gross. Definitely funny and I wont ruin it for you, but personally the ending made my skin crawl and the very end was just oddly strange and left me feeling like man, I'm sorta uneasy right now. Weird, I know. Sorta left me wanting more, but it definitely ends... So, for that, this book offered an interesting experience b.c it makes you jump out of your skin. Nothing about this book is normal and based on that, I liked it.
