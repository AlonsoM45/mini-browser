Bought this toy for my 2 year old grand daughter and she really loves it!!!walks around all day with the picnic basket and plays feeding her dolls etc with all the cuos, cuttlery ,bread and cheese.She also loves the music and songs.just right size pieces to have  if you  a have younger baby sister around.not dangerous.Great toy and not expensive at all for what it is.thank you
