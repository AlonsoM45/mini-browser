I purchased the Monsoon Gearslinger as a handy pack that I could carry on short outting and in the truck as a emergency bag if need be on long road trips...and for this use it has worked well. I am a big fan of Maxpedtion and their fine line of durable and well thought out bags, backpacks and pouches of all types are fine products...I have used this pack on several short 10 mile hikes and to attend all day events like festivals, sporting events and shooting matches..it has worked well. The pack rides comfortably over your shoulder and generally stays in place, well constructed, amble pockets with many internal and external achoring points and conpartments,very quickly removed and remounted, items are easily eccessible within the intercompartment. Once again Maxpedition has not let me down...its not a perfect all purpose pack but for quick excess, short hike or day outing as well as bag to throw in the vehicle slung over the seat works very well.
