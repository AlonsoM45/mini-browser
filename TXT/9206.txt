This case is perfect for a slim gummy case effect. It fits very well on my samsung galaxy note 2. I love the feel. Its very velvety and soft feeling  my charger fits in without any hassle. The only downfall is that the case does have a slight smell. It kinda smells like plastic or rubber. Its not really strong. At first I could smell it in the air around my phone but after having on my phone for about 6 hours I only smell it when I sniff the case  other than that this is a great product. I do recommend it.
