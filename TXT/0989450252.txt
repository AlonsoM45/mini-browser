This is by far on  of my favorites right up there with SC Stephens thoughtless trilogy.I don't knowingly to put in words how much I loved these books.  I have read hundreds of books and this was by far one of the best.  Thank you K. Bromberg for a great series.  I can't wait to see what you have next for us.  Absolutely lovedIt!!!!
