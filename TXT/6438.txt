The size chosen for me from their sizes fit perfectly. The sleeve length and body length of the coat are perfect. It arrived ahead of expected delivery time, I am very happy about that! The ONLY thing wrong with the product was that the actual thing was 2 shades darker than advertised. Colour perfection is not a priority of mine, because I am happy so long as I can tell what the cosplay is with a  glance. However, if colour accuracy is a priority of yours, then so be it. I LOVE my new cosplay, thank y'all so much!!!!
