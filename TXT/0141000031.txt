this was a text book for a university class so i needed it quickly and the book was in perfect condition and delivered extremely fast.one quality concern... a group of about 20-30 pages were not cut at the top properly so they were formed together almost as one thick page which i had to tear apart. i did not find it a big enough deal to complain or file anything as the seller was very exceptionalthank you!
