Purchased 12 of these units for conducting roadside work.  They work well for their purpose, but with wear and tear, the top cap falls off and becomes unusable (until duct tape is applied).  Aside from that, a good purchase based on price, but needs to be handled with care.  Not designed to be used as miniature lightsabres, but can withstand this type of abuse.
