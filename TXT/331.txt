This short story was cute and funny! It doesn't have anything to do with Devereux so if you are expecting that then you will be disappointed. If you really love this series like I do then you should definately read this shorty story as well. Just don't try to read this without reading the other books that came before it or you will definatley not get it. I recommend reading them all for sure!
