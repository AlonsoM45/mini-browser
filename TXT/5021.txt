I ordered 120 of these lights. Only 2 of 120 did not work, but my fiance managed to fix them both.There were 4 batteries that didn't work as well.I didn't receive any extra batteries in my order like the description stated. Otherwise, I'm happy with the lights.I also tested one out last night submerged in water.I put it in at 8pm, this morning when I left for work at 7am, it was still working fine
