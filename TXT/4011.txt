The worms arrived quickly, however due to a slightly ambiguous email from seller I thought they would not be shipped until the following week so the day they arrived I didn't check the mail.  The next day when I checked it I thought my worms were going to be dead because it was well below freezing that night and when I opened the package some of the dirt was frozen.  I got worried but then I spread the dirt out and let it thaw and in an hour or so all of the worms were wriggling away happily.  All of them were alive not one had died.  When I put them in my worm bin all of them burrowed and none were left on the top.
