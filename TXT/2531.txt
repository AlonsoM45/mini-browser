Most "how to" or "do it yourself" books I have read through make me cringe with incorrect information or bad product advice. Mr Litchfield's book is NOT to be included in this category. Thoughtfully laid out with photos, easy to read descriptions and plans make this book a must have for anyone thinking of tackling their own project or hiring someone else. My Nephew has recently bought his first home and has asked for tools for Christmas. I can't think of a better tool than this book, (And it's far less dangerous than anything with a chord attached). I will also add a copy for each new employee I hire as required reading. Well done Mr. Litchfield!!
