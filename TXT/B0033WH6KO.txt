One of the BEST exercise DVD's I've ever used ... seeing results already - but it means I HAVE to do the workout. At 64 I also can choose how &#34;hard&#34; to work and which ones I need to modify until I get sronger.  And because it's in 10 minute increments, I can choose to do 10, 20, 30 or more minutes and which exercises to do  ... thank YOU! Fantastic price and was in great condition ... now my turn!
