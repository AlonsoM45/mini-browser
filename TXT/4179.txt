1 They are a lot smaller than I expected. 2 I can buy these pillows at wal greens and big lots for 5 to 10 dollars. When I saw the commercial it looked like something never made before but its the same stuff they use in those cheap pillows at the drugstore. So I was a little disappointed but it's OK. The seller was great!!!! Everything I wrote about that was a problem was my own mistake the seller wrote the dimensions and I expected something without doing my own homework. I am saving her/him the seller and I will be doing business with her/him again
