WOW. Where to begin? I love these for so many reasons. I am giving as a gift to my husband, a HUGE Pirates of the Caribbean fan. I will wrap up a gift card in one, and tickets for a special gift somewhere for him (surprise) in another. Absolutely lovely, the way the map is &#34;burned&#34; tattooed into the &#34;leather&#34; and looks so realistic. A must have for any Pirates fan, or collectible for a nice way to give a gift it. HIGHLY Recommend this lovely item.
