Very cool design usb data cable that lights up blue while charging and moves at faster rate if battery of phone is dead and needs it, slowing down once battery is full then cutting itself off. Only down side is that i wish it came in a longer cord style so i could plug into wall outlet and run up my wall to dresser docking station! Overall i like it.
