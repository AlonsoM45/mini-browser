I seriously love how it left my hair. I only bleached the tips (ombre style) and used this brand. Its a really rich, dark purple but will lighten up eventually. The only thing I hate about it is that it literally stains everything. I have to wash my bathtub with bleach to wipe it off. Other than that, its really awesome! I totally recommend it.
