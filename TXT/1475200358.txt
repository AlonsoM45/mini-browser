I loved this book because it held the gritty details of only a child surviving the mental illness of parental addiction could tell. It tells the story of how extremely difficult a child has to fight to survive day to day, month to month and year to year in the crazy chaotic world an alcoholic parent creates for their child.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants or needs a better understanding of the battle a child of an alcoholic parent faces or has endured.Thank you Marlayna for being brave enough to live through it and tell the world about it. You amaze me.
