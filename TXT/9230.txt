"After the Cure" seemed like a totally different story from "The Cure" - different characters, different place with a thread of the first story in it.  I never even found out who was in the hooded robe in the closing scene of the last book. Isn't that what sequels are for? To continue the original story and explain? The grammar and punctuation weren't very good either. I really think they need a new editor, or at least a proofreader!
