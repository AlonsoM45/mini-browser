Eddie Jones begins his book with a disclaimer that it is a collection of supporting material from the classes he teaches, and is not a "full-blown writing book." Be that as it may, this short read contains more direct practical advice than many of the "full-blown" books I've read on fiction writing. focusing on four prevailing elements of good fiction --- plot, dialogue, characters and scenes --- Jones covers the essence of these, identifying where an author can go wrong and providing good examples of the right way to do it. Do I wish at times that he had gone into a point more fully? Of course, but then I would have had to invest far more time in reading the book. I like how pithy and succinct this book is --- similar to some of the advice he gave me when I wrote (and revised) my first novelThe Case of the Exploding Speakeasy. I'm sure I'll be referring to A Novel Idea again and again as I write my next novel.
