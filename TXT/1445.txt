I really love this concealer palet. I am able to use this through out the year from spring, all the way through winter. It has so many shades. It sometimes creases when I use a primer, so I suggest using it without one. It works great, and conceals really good :) I used the lightest shade as a base for my eye shadow. I am going to purchase again. Its my everyday concealer.
