new to flying ive dipped into the bag 3 times once for a shackle that controls the fly bar where else am I going to get that part glad I ordered at the same time I ordered heli because coming from china it took 3 weeks to get here but when I needed it there it was I also ordered a 5 pack of 200 mha batterys also a worth while wait ,china,,but more power and longer flight time you will have to manually adjust trim as it will drift backwards with added weight
