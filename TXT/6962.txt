Iin my job as Head-of-maintenance(fancy for&#34;I fix stuff&#34;) ,I carry about 50 keys at all times. I kept getting more keys(still getting more) and needing bigger key rings. As title suggests, I got a large split ring hoping it would solve my problems. It began stretching and distorting. It was difficult to remove and replace keys(as for copying at the locksmith's) and I got fed up and started looking for new options!I found these on Amazon and decided to give them a try. (They arrived early and well packaged) before I'd finished putting all my keys on these new tools, I threw away the split ring, realizing that this was my answer!  I have better accessiblity. I use multiple cables looped on a carabiner and am able to categorize the keys for easy location and it has had the un forseen bbenefit of being more comfortable.The only cons I can see are the screw couplers on the ends. They come unthreaded(unscrewed) periodically and all the keys fall onthe ground.  This is a simple thing to counteract. I put a small bit of tape on the male end when I screw them together. This adds a little needed friction. There are other substances and materials one could use to do the same job.
