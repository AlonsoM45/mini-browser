This book was a travel adventure without ever leaving the sofa.  So many things that make a book a good read are in this one.  Travel, adventure, history, whimsy, biographical, bit of comedy.  I have been to many of the places covered in this book and really enjoyed the revisit.  Definitely looking forward to the next adventure!!!!
