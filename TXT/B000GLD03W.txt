Nice big metal birdhouse. Good construction. Has three sections so you can fill up to three different types of feed. Big enough to where other birds don't scare off smaller birds if one or another is on an opposing side. lol I hung this using a metal rod style pole that grips to deck or porch, if this feeder filled makes the rod droop you can always put in vice and bend it to the right height you need it to stay. This feeder also is great and comes with post option mounting. Only thing is i wish the top was a little bigger than bottom as to better keep rain off or make more shade.
