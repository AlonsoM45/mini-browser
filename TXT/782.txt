My baby is 11 old months and 3 weeks. He couldn't feet anymore in the last car seat it was very uncomfortable for him that he is a little told guy. The recaro Prosport is very easy to put on the car. My baby looks great with the red color he looks great and he sleeps comfortable. In my car looks amazing is very good quality, safe and easy to buckle.
