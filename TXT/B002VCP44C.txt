The 2600 has to be manually operated. When I first set it up, I swear it would automatically place the time in column 1 and the next box over or when the clock goes past noon, it would place the pm out date right nex to the in time. I contacted customer support and ther person helping me had me reset the unit. After that evry time the an employee wants to clock in and out it all has to be done manually. If you pay a little more money and get the next model up, you will be happier I think. By the way, I called back to customer service tech help several times and anyone helping me after the first person didn't seem to know anything about the 2600.
