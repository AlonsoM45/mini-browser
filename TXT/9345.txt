I looked at some reviews and they said the back of the shoe was loose and it was sliding off the back of their heel and I was worried about purchasing the getta pump. I bought it and when I received them in the mail I tried them on immediately! I was so worried that they would be impossible for me to wear cause I broke my foot and some heels really irritate where I broke it. I tried them on and they fit perfectly. The heel was loose when I got them but if you gently squeeze the top of the back of the shoe it will fit more appropriately to your foot. The toe area wasn't tight and was comfortable to stand or walk in  for long periods of time. What surprised me was the amount of cushion in the bottom of the shoe. It had much more than Aldo and Jessica Simpson shoes. With the cushioning, low heel, and hidden platform this shoe would be wonderful for both "experienced" heel wearers and beginners. The color is the actual true nude color. Its not too pink or too sand. Its also great you can dress this shoe up or wear it casually. I am so thrilled I bought this Steve madden shoe!! And the cherry on top was the low price I bought them for. The only bad thing about this shoes is if you have really wide feet I could see an issue. I wear an A in shoe width and this shoes fit perfect. I might could see the toe being a little tight if you normally get a C width. It does run true to size. But be aware sometimes your heel size is different than other shoes. I wear a 7.5 in heels but 8 in flats. And i ordered 7.5 and it fit just fine. Overall this is one of the best pair of heels I've bought!
