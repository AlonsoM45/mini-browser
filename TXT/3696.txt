Works good for me, no irritation and smells good for two days even without a shower. Overall the dry solid is best choice as the clear gels are messy and seem to not last as good. Appears to have the same amount of metal as others in it but this brand works best out of using right guard, mens dove, axe, mitchum, or old spice.
