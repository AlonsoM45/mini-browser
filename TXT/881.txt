I ordered this dvd for my car since it had a decent rating.  It doesn't work properly.  First of all it takes a long time to start playing a disc and then it gets stuck for no reason.  I put in new dvds that definitely weren't scratched and still had the same problem of taking a few minutes till it started playing and then it constantly stops in middle.  These problems are from the beginning it never worked properly.  I'm also upset because I spent a lot also to install it into my car.Do not buy this product unless you are looking to through out your money.
