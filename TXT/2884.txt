As a teacher, I am constantly looking for books that highlight the struggles our forefathers had in forging this great nation. There are plenty of books that do that job extremely well. &#34;Dear America: The Winter of Red Snow&#34; is an excellent historical fiction book that contains some great details of the hardships of Valley Forge. Rush Limbaugh's book, however, is not a good example.I have no personal bias toward Mr. Limbaugh. Like most pundits, he seems to be spot on at times and wildly irrational at others. There's no denying he's an exceptionally gifted orator, but that doesn't mean he'll smoothly transition into a historical fiction writer. But even if you have never heard of Mr. Limbaugh you wouldn't be able to read this book without wondering if he had a background in politics. Rush's own political views appear frequently throughout the book. This is fine if you are aligned with his views, but if you are trying to teach history from the standpoint of those that actually lived it, then this book will definitely be misleading. It's also a bit inaccurate at times on the roles of key leaders.It also doesn't help the credibility of his book that the image on the cover is the same image used to sell Rush's tea products. (An image that's a bit narcissistic at best). If this is designed to teach, as Limbaugh repeatedly claims, then it shouldn't be an advertisement.If you love Rush, then I ask that you approach the book with caution and understand what it is, a slightly biased, slightly egotistical, slightly stereotypical (at least against the Natives), and slightly inaccurate retelling of the events of the arrival of the Pilgrims. Just as you wouldn't want your hair dresser installing your catheter or your dentist landing a 747, perhaps Rush should stick at the job his excels at and not venture into a world best left to true children's historical writers.
