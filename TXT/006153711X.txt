I haven't read that book, but saw the movie based on it. I believe many of you did and if not, I greatly recommend you to do so. I loved the movie, so when I saw this book I had no doubts I should read it. I wasn't wrong, this book is really impressive and it really gives you simple but very powerful lessons for life. Many people struggle in life having no clue where to start and Start Where You Are would be a great choice to start with.Chris covers everything, starting from the circumstances where everybody are at the moment then going on to the past experiences, mastery, simple everyday steps, spirituality and finally to the lessons of really happy life.Most of the lessons in similar or different words I got from other books I've read before. What I liked the most about this book is that all the necessary lessons are really clearly distinguished in one book. Everything is explained in simple words and thoughts. Moreover, this book is not about finances and money. Chris does say that money is important in life, but he talks about it just as a result of happy life. So in this book you can find everything what can be called a really happy life.Do you have any other lessons of happy life? Share with others!
