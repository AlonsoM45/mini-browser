First, the only reason it gets one star is because ZERO is not an option!!Half the bag contains Myrrh (if thats what it is) so fine is like fine sand... the rest of the tiny pieces look like dirt.. cant see ANY RESIN at all in the bag...  looks NOTHING like other stuff I have!  stay clear of this stuff .
