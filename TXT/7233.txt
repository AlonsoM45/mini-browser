Easy to install and It fits well on my window sill above the kitchen sink.  The always full canister flows smoothly and fast compared to faucet-mounted filter canisters.  But the instruction to disassemble the filter canister was faulty in that the opening direction of counter clockwise was quite ambiguous as to whether the it is the base or the canister that must be turned counter clockwise?
