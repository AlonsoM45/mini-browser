I cannot say enough good about Alastair Sim. This is a must have. I HIghly recommend it. It is a tradition for me and my family to watch this beginning around Thanksgiving. It is heart warming. I had it on VHS and upgraded to this blue ray and even another for my son. This is true great acting. If I could only wish you would watch one movie at the Holidays, I would HIGHLY Recommend you watch this one. Remember what Christmas is really about. Giving. Sharing. Loving. Helping. GOD Bless us,  Everyone!
