More like an Ingmar Bergman film than a BBC detective story.  Multi layered character studies. Wrenching and tortured relationships and some of the the most graphic and beautiful  cinematography I've ever seen in a crime series.Plot twists. Tortured relationships and a driven detective make this, in my opinion, one of the best TV productions I have ever had the pleasure to warch.
