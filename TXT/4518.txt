This candy tasted good but is good only if you do not have any side effects from it. I tried it twice and on both occasions, it caused me massive and incapacitating diarrhea. I do not have lactose intolerance nor any other food allergy. No sure what is contained in these candies that caused me massive diarrhea (12-14 watery stools within next 12-14 hours). Were these infected ? Did they have toxin? Not sure if this batch was defective or generally contains harmful substances. I ate these candies around a year back at which time they seemed to be fine. But this time, they caused me lots of trouble. I am sure that these candies caused my symptoms as I tried nothing new nor did I eat out.  Just had these candies on 2 separate occasions 2 days apart. At the first incidence, I couldn't believe that a candy can cause diarrhea to a non allergenic person so ate it again 2 days after and had similar bouts of diarrhea, this time even worse just a couple of hours after having candies.Pretty sure that these caused the diarrhea. Not to mention that I am pretty tolerant to anything and everything in food. Had no food allergies so far. Won't recommend these to anyone.
