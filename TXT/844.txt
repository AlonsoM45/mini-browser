As of right now the game quality for the PC is terrible. When you can actually get the game to run and finish a game (which is very rarely), the game play is fun and graphics are great but out of the 10 games I played last night I only finished two. The rest of the games ended with generic "something went wrong" messages. I am very disappointed in the quality and I am frankly tired of game producers rushing their release dates for shoddy game play. However as I speak new patches are coming in everyday to better the server issues, and as I mentioned before the game, when functional, is fun and worth the $60.00. What you would be getting at this point in time isn't worth $20.00. My advice would be to wait for Black Friday and get a better price and hopefully by then, a better product following all the up coming patches. Really wish I would have waited instead of pre-ordering.
