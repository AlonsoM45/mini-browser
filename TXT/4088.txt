the wrist strap would only go over a real small hand and the belt holster is a joke, the unit snags in the holster and has to be fumbled with to get out.  that takes security out of the picture.  one of the electrodes was loose, easy fix but just one more reason not to trust the overall quality.  i would avoid anything with this brand name.
