Do not try to connect anything other than a PS3 or Xbox360 controller, like i did. I bought this intending to use a Logitech F310 controller with Xbox thinking than if it regularly works with PS3 than it must work with Xbox using this adapter, as it must convert any PS3 operating controller into a Xbox controller, right? Wrong!
