My granddaughter choose the &#34;Paris Theme&#34; for her bedroom. she likes the modern look more than the &#34;old fashioned&#34; as she called it.I have to steer away from &#34;to much Eiffel Tower&#34; as she wants more variety than just that. Amazon has a better variety than say Hobby Lobby which tends to cater to a younger girls, you know pink, sparkly...that sort of thing is just not Destiny anymore.
