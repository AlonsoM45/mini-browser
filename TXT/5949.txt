I bought these along with a combo pack of woodchips for our new electric smoker, and i must recommend them to everyone who handles meat in the kitchen or in the grill/oven/smoker. They are very heat resistant, durable, and are very easy to clean and keep sanitized. Great price aswell.The only thing i can think of as a con is that most meat, especially if it has a rub or sauce or any kind of juice/liquid on it is very slippery in these gloves, but that is because of the material they are made from.
