These are definitely not my idea of slip ons. They are incredibly stiff and even though I sized up, I could not get them on my feet. I have never had that issue before. They are nice looking and have great tread and perhaps they would stretch? But I wasn't willing to deal with the discomfort to find out. Back they went.
