Alton Gansky's story of a grounded astronaut who gets a second chance to go into space has everything --- absorbing plot, intense suspense, strong but vulnerable characters, and engaging detail. His ability to add enough technical information to make you feel like you are there, as well as his deep insight into human nature, combine to add a realism to the novel that tingles your spine. I could swear that Gansky had been an astronaut, and after reading Zero-G, I feel like I've been one, too.The complexity of the plot make it hard to categorize --- is it sci-fi, action/suspense, murder mystery? In some strange way, it is all three, and Gansky manages to weave it all together like a master storyteller. This is one novel that could easily be made into a movie.
