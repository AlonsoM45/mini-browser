This 50ft CAT5e cable is great, especially for the low price of just $4.68!I'm using it to connect my surveillance camera DVR (which is hidden in a cabinet in the dining room) to my AT&T; router/modem, and it's working perfectly. I ran it along the baseboard from the dining room to the living room (there isn't a wall dividing the dining room and living room in my house).I'm very glad I found this. The 50ft CAT5 cable at Walmart is around $30.
