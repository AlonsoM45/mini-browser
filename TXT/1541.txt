I bought this set for the compressor.The only nuisance is it cycles a lot because it builds pressure very quickly...would be nice if cutoff and turn on pressure were adjustable to keep it from cycling so much, but for the price...On start up (especially the first time we ran it) it seems to struggle a little but it does not appear to be a major issue. It hasn't overheated even with long runs.The airbrushes are cheapy Badger clones but work well enough, as long as they are taken care of they will last for a long time. They produce nice lines, blends and fades. Three airbrushes with the compressor cost the almost as much one quality airbrush and no compressor, So it's pretty much impossible to come up with anything bad to say about them. You get what you pay for and then some. As I said above take care of them and they'll last, take the time to mix your paint and set them up right and they'll give good results. Bear in mind these are NOT a replacement for professional grade kit, but plenty good for hobby projects.
