I recommend this book for everybody! It's worth to read itIt's no easy learn another language, but either impossible one just need discipline, commitment, and value to go ahead and get it.The Second Edition is very good. I am glad to have read the Second Edition, because I was going to invest more money in the academy, but I realized that I need more practice with my English. I need a job where I have to speak English,  and a Social English Circle to improve it. No more grammar nor boring books. I need to speak a lot to get more confidence and pass to another level.Thank You Daniel!
