I've had this camera now for about a month and used it extensively in the garden and traveling.  The pictures are crisp and clear and the amount of functions are amazing for this price range.  It took a while to get used to the function dial, but I really like being able to toggle between auto and specfic functions like 'vivid'. The view finder is a little off but I'm so glad to have it as an option to the screen. It was really hard finding a camera in this price range with a real view finder.  Thankful to come across this camera. Totally enjoying it and the batteries last well when not in movie mode.
