I love CONTIGO products, over the years i've owned three. One stainless for coffee, one water bottle, and now this one. I like the locking mechanism on this and never leaks. The double wall is nice but will still sweat on hot days with a cold drink. I wish they had put insulation or styrofoam substance in between. Contigo makes good stuff
