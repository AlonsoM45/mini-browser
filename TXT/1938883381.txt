I liked this book. The story was good, the characters also goo, the writing good. I was pleasantly surprised, to be honest. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did.. I didn't really connect with the characters though... I don't know why... Even so, this was a nice read and maybe I will read it again in the future, who knows? I will be reading other books by this author for sure.I loved getting to know Maine. I didn't really knew that much about it, so I was happy to get such depth and detail of it's history, landscape and all that. I really loved that!Another thing I loved was the mystery in this book and how it unfolded. Maybe it's a weird thing to say, but I predictable but unpredictable. My head hurts trying to figure that one out. xDSo this is a good book and I liked it. But it wasn't more then that for me. Good, but not great. That's why I gave it 3.5 stars. Good job A.D.! I look forward to read more from you in the future.
