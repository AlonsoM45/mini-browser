Short review for a pretty short book.Even though the idea of this book was something that I quite liked, the book itself didn't do it for me. The writing wasn't great, not good enough to suck me into the story. And the main character was a bit annoying. I'm sorry, but this book is not as good as I hoped it to be. Allison acted way to hard-to-get with Ethan, which was the main thing that annoyed me about her and I just didn't get any feels in this book. (That's a must for me. I need the feels.)The concept of the Danaans, the fairies from Ireland, was interesting and for that I give the book credit because it's the only thing that made the book good. But for the rest, it just wasn't for me. Sorry!
