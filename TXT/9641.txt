This radio is advertised to work for the new iPhone 5...however you have to buy an adapter for it to work. If you have the older versions than this radio will work well. Got this as a gift and had to return it due to the fact that it does NOT work with the iPhone 5 without said adapter. When I looked up the adapter it was roughly $15
