Had problems pretty much from the start. Customer service was great helped me resolve the first issue froze up. Then it started acting up again a few weeks later and I just gave up on it. Nothing against the seller but this tablet is crap. It is slow even with added memory and now wont even boot up just says updating.....and never stops updating...no matter how many times you reset it.
