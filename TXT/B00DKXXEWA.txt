I have been using the keyboard for about 3 months. It has been as sturdy as the first time. Typing on the ipad mini is now so much better! One dislike is the fact that the keyboard does not work when we have to log in to a wifi network at a hotel. When a pop up screen appears for me to key in the passcode, I cannot seem to type uding the ZAGG. I have to open a document, type in what I need to, then copy and paste it on the pop up screen. Another issue is that the play or pause buttons cannot be used on spotify.Otherwise, I think its a great typing tool to have. Thanks!
