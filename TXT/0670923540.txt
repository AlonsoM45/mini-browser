You will definitely see life through different eyes after reading this book! Brene Brown is brilliant and brings so much to life that we take advantage of. This is not a fad or the next best thing, this is reality, a way of life. You will feel empowered and transformed, you will appreciate and recognize your own vulnerability and courageous acts of others. I truly brings you back down to a good, comfortable place where you can enjoy yourself and others without be critical and embrace life as it is.Great for anybody! Highly recommended! Love her style and how she gets her message out!
