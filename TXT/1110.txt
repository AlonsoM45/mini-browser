Love this game! Slow generating coins at first but when you get to higher levels it's not too bad. Was on level 100 then had to swap out my kindle and even after syncing I lost all my prizes and started at level 1! Really mad I spent money to get coins, don't think I'll do that again just incase I have another problem with my kindle.
