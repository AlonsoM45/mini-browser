For more of my reviews, visit my blog [...]We're thrown right into action from the first page. The book begins where we left of in Nightshade. It's packed with information. We learn about Searchers and their world, the real story of the war between Searchers and Keepers and Shay's role in all of this. Even if the pacing was slower because of all the information thrown at the reader, it was necessary, the author had to explain everything before getting into the plot. I loved learning about the truth at the same time as the pack. Some stories surprised me like the one about Ren's mother.Like I said in the review of the previous book, I loved the characters. It was the same in this one. I was anxious to find out what happened to all of them when Calla left at the end of Book 1 because I could very well imagine that it would not be good for them. I can only think of Ansel, Calla's brother...  The new characters introduced in this novel were interesting. I absolutely loved Connor and his humor even when everything was going wrong. His bickering with Silas made me smile. And what happens with Ethan, his evolution, is cute.Overall, it was a good read. I felt like nothing really happened. But the next book will be filled with action that's for sure!
