This book, now a classic, gives God great glory for His work in Bruce Olson's life.  As a missionary, I certainly would not recommend many of the things that Bruce did in the beginning, bur his appreciation of the culture and the people has been wonderful and the Lord has worked greatly in the lives of the people.  Read with discernment and see God at work.Robert Patton, MDMissionary to Suriname
