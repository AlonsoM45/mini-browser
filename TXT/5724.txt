Book. Arrived in good order and very quickly. My only disappointment was the postage and handling black plastic bag stapled and that cost me over 10.00. When the book weighed no more than 150gms. Was willing to pay because present for someone who had been looking for this book for a long while. Don't know that I would do it again would rather pay more for book
