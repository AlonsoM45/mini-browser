We bought these for our LG tv and compared the the glasses it came with these are great.  They don't look as stupid as the other glasses, both the lens and the frame are made better then the LG glasses and they fit kids and adults. My only complaint is that one pair the lens pops out when I clean them. Those were the purple ones my 3 year old called dibs on though so that may be her doing, I'm not sure.
