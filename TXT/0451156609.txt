now here is some terrific horror all right, this one is done by my master king, its already a classic only twenty five years since it came out, i don't even know where to begin praising it so ill just praise it. you see with the right horror like this you have to have a ground of not-horror, you cant have the whole world just horrible like some sneaky writers do because then you don't have any place to feel whats horrifying and whats not. thats what my professor calls the stability factor. you see, if everythings horrifying then nothing is, it just feels all yucky.this ones a good example of how horrors the new great genre like plays were in shakespeares time, back when they wanted poetic words so the bard had to make all his words that way. now kings like my master king don't have to be all showoff that way because they get to you through the real stuff, his talking straight in language you know since you were in the playground, the point is in the eerie world they make. the words arent there to show off what a great word maker he is and get in the way of the story but to open you right into what youre looking at, the characters and all the tension that develops. that's right, the words are like clear windows. now thats literature, thats what peoplell be reading in five centuries, if theyll even talk of hamlet anymore.i wont give away the story anymore than this, ill just say the scariest thing is when you realize these things get into peoples blood through using computers you start to think uh-oh what if this computer im using lets some creatures in through the screen. talking about computer bugs and bots and viruses. but ill just say go get it and flip right through hundred of pages of gripping gripping scared out of your britches but you always come back to where you are in the end and everything is all right.
