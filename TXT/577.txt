I bought this for my new iphone, which was working perfectly fine. once i put this on my phone, all of a sudden i had no service anywhere i went.  I talked to my friend, who is a technology guru, and he told me it was because of the metal on the phone interfering with the radio on the phone. as soon as i took the case off, i had service everywhere again. DONT BUY THIS. although it look pretty cool.
