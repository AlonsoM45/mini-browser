I decided to buy the paperwhite over the other kindles for the main fact that it's simple. Maybe not so much as went into designing it, but the use of it, the way it performs and everything. No frills, no gimmicks. It's simple! And I absolutely love it! I've already read 5 books on it in the 4 weeks that I've had it. Living in a small town means that there's not any bookstores. Nor is there any good ones within a miles drive. So convenience was a definite factor, and the Kindle Paperwhite provides that, (much like the other Kindle products I'm sure). Did I get what I payed for? Absolutely, and a lot more than I expected, and being an Amazon product I expected a lot ;)
