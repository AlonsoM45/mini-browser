When I received this product I was hoping I would be able to extend my laptop battery life, I followed the instructions regarding letting the battery completing discharge then re-charge 2-3 times.  After doing this the product was no better than my original battery of 6 years old.  The battery life was horrible.  The battery life did not extend to anything close to the times stated by the battery's description or by other users.Luckily, I was able to get a credit of $24 back from the vendor.  This was the result of a complaint I made to them regarding excessive costs at the USPS to send the product back to CA from MO.BUYER BEWARE!good luck
