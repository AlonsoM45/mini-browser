I literally stayed up til 4:30 in the  morning reading this book. I got Bound by Blood yesterday. The lovely Mrs . Jackson has created a realistic storyline, that doesn't include sparkling vampires and I am hooked. My only real complaint  are the covers, if the man in book has long blond hair, then the cover should not have short dark hair!  Other than the cover this series is outstanding. Just what a person wants in a book ...... ..a bit of fantasy, comedy, romance, and mystery.
