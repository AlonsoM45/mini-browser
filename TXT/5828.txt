I was skeptical when I first ordered this product because I thought that they were expensive for only getting 12 small blocks. However, the price is definitely worth it. The small size of the blocks is perfect for their little hands, but not too small where she has the potential to choke on them.I LOVE all the HABA products that I own because they are safe for my LO to put in her mouth (wooden blocks with non-toxic paint). The majority of my daughter's favorite toys are HABA products.
