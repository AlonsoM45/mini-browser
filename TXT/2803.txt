When I ordered this, I had a 34DD chest and 38&#34; hip. I had gotten a large. But it hugged my hips and butt really tight and unflattering, and strapped my boobs down, thus making them look saggy. I loved the color and material, and if you  are more petite, this would be great for you! But for curvier girls, like myself, I would not recommend.
