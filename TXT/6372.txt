The way it's written is just beautiful. She brings you into these people's lives and makes you part of their journey. You will rejoice with their accomplishments and cry throughout their disappointments and heartbreaks. Not once did I lose interest in this book. I have taken the characters into my life and that is a show of a passionate writer. I thank you for the privilege of being invited to read this work of art. Can't wait to read the next book!!!!
