After reading reviews on many lights I finally chose this one and couldn't be happier with my choice!! It cures my Gelish polish perfectly, light bulbs are easy to put in and replace and the light has so much hand room! I was so sick of hitting my nails on my old LED light but I don't have to worry about that with this light. If you're looking for a good light to cure gel nails this one is a great choice!
