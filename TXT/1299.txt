I loved this case, it just looks nice and clean and well put together. It's not bulky and keeps your phone nice and thin, not slippery. Cut out openings are very precise, didn't have any trouble getting my S-pen out or using the camera. I was so heartbroken when I had to give it away, though. I have a Zagg screen protector on my Note II and after having this case on my phone for about 30 minutes my Zagg started lifting and bubbling on one corner. The inside of the case is a little too sharp to have a screen protector. I still blame the Zagg though, I feel it doesn't sit well on the screen (it extends to the edges too much). I really loved this case but, because the Zagg was a $30 purchase, I had to go with another case. If you don't have a screen protector that doesn't extend too far to the edges of your screen then you should be fine. I'm just sad I couldn't use it.
