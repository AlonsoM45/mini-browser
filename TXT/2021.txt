I have bought other cheaper HID kits before on amazon, but I never will again. The kensun HID kit is the clearest, easy to install kit I have ever bought. They have been working for 2 months now with no flickering, or any other issues. Looks like right out of the factory.  Its worth the extra money to buy a good brand like kensun, trust me.
