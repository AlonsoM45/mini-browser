I was introduced to Mokha Origin coffee two months ago, when the company's founder offered me a cup--with neither sugar nor cream. At first, I was hesitant to try this, or any, coffee black. But after that first sip, I understood why he had insisted I take it plain; this coffee was too good to have its perfect balance of rich aroma and delicate notes corrupted by saccharine or dairy additions. Mokha Origin is coffee to be enjoyed, not endured for the sake of caffeine delivery. It is an experience, and one that I look forward to indulging in again and again.
