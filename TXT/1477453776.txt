This short book outlines the life of Herbert Grings, missionary to both Africa and South America.  Grings was definitely a bit eccentric, but effective.  What is most impressive is the number of missionaries who have come from his family, now in the fourth generation.  Matthew Champlin, who helped rewrite the book, is himself a 4th generation missionary from Grings.Robert. D. Patton, M.D., D.d.
