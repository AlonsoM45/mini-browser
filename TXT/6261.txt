We've ordered pieces from Sauder before, but this was was really junky. We had to order replacement parts twice because they kept arriving all scratched up. Pieces are not packed well. After we built it, it looks like the shelves are way too small for the cabinet. There is all kinds of space on either side of the shelves.I'd avoid this.
