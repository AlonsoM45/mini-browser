It does a decent job of removing 85% of the hair from the root, but the rest just gets cut down really short, I have seen the hair come back slower and thinner as it should. And I am using it in conjunction with the Kalo Hair Inhibitor treatment. I have reviewed that product as well for those of you whom may be interested.
