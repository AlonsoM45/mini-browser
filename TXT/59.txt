for being on a budget, this came out as a great buy, and it matches my coby mp3 player's color scheme so thats another plus for me. i have the earphones for when im taking a walk and the headphones are comfortable and just such a nice sound while using that completely overpowers whatever junk my roommate listens to. money well spent in my opinion
