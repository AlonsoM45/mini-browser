It is a good dictionary with an old fashion performance. There is no colorful picture to attract my eyes. Words in the addenda should be inserted into the existing entries. The typing is more like my grandfather's first dictionary printed in Netherlands in 1950s. However, there are some specific elements to let me justified that it is a four starred dictionary. The first is the abundance of word entries which is not found in any other dictionaries. Secondly, the amazing printed size book, which caused other people to think that I might be a great lexicographer while carrying the book. Thirdly, it has been the dictionary of my dream since I was in secondary school. What a subjective reviews!!! I recommend you to have one if you are serious in exploring English through words.
