I liked how the layout of the pouches were. They held all my tools that I need. I hate making many trips to the truck so I carry everything in my pouches so that part was great. Also, the suspenders didn't hinder my overhead reach much compared to other suspenders that I've tried. Being an electrician I often do work off ladders, having arm movement is a must so that was nice.  The biggest problem I had was that I wore the belt a week and it started fraying around the metal gromits. At first I just took a lighter and melted the nylon but it soon became too much of a problem for being a new belt.
