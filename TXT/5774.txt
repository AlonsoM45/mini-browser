I've been a Roger Hodgson fan for many years and have been faithfully seeing his concerts every time he tours the US. When Roger is off touring on another continent and I have the need to feel his live experience this is the CD I turn to. The audio is masterfully mixed and very rich with full tones. The suspense builds with the cheers of the crowd on the opening track of Take the Long Way Home all the way through to the close of It's Raining Again with the satisfied roars of the audience.Just as he does in his shows, as soon as Roger starts to play and sing, you are grasped, reeled in for a very special and magical adventure. His voice just simply soars....  Impeccable musicianship and I can very easily say these tracks are stronger than the original album versions. You can just feel his music, through and through.The set list is perfect - one moving song after another, songs varying our many feelings of profound joy, earnest longing, breathtaking wonder and fervent "seeking" -1. Take The Long Way Home2. Give A Little Bit4. Breakfast In America5. Only Because Of You/ Lord Is It Mine?6. The Logical Song7. School8. Dreamer9. Two Of Us10. It's Raining AgainWith the empty silence after the close of another fantastic musical journey, I ask myself where have I been? Was it just a dream? :)
