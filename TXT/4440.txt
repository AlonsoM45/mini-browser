there was nothing in this book that came with any surprise. the epilogue was far more interesting than the whole book. seems like the author wrote this just to finish up the mess she started with a mind to give Ana and Christian a happy ending.I still look forward to what will come next from EL. James, but only if it is unrelated to the damn fifty shades.
