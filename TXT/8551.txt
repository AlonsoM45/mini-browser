defective product which made a huge mess after installed. After installed, turned water on and it blew the handle off all the way to the ceiling, made my husband fall, soaked the walls, ceiling, runied stuff in my bathroom including my expensive blow dryer which got soaked inside so can no longer be used. We needed the faucet replaced for my son's 1st birthday party tomorrow and now the guest have no bathroom to wash their hands in. It's cheaply made and the part the bolt to the handle screws into is made of plastic and is stripped which is what caused the handle to blow off with such force. We got soaked in just seconds. I want a refund
