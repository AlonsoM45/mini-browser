My husband has diabetes and a size 13 foot but the diabetic socks are so loose. He looks for socks that aren't too tight around the ankle. I had bought Hanes that were thicker in the foot but they also ended up tighter on the ankle.  He seems to like these just fine. I will most likely buy them again.
