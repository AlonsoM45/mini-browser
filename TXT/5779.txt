Jackson should be a lesson for a lot of the new 'so called country signer'. I don't know where the others get the ideas we want to see the same ol' type of videos over and over; i.e. the four wheel trucks, the parties, the flashes of how many one second photos can we show, in one of the same type, of over and over videos Jackson has kept his 'cowboy' hat, and not reverted to the ball cap on backwards. It's good to have some of the 'real country' still left, like Alan Jackson.
