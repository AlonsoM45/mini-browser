My granddaughter celebrated her 12th birthday this year. Her theme, you guessed it, Peacock! the feathers were a little smaller than expected and fell apart quite easily if they are touched to much but in a vase they were perfect. I especially like that they were shipped earlier than said which turned out to be a really good thing.
