BAD MOVE WITH THESE LED LAMPSMy plan was to replace my Halogen Lamps of about 3000 hours life expectancy with these. Typical LED Lamps last 50,000 hours. Not only would I be saving energy, but they would be lasting 15+ times longer.Out of the (18) I purchased less than 2 months ago only two still are working.....soon to be DEAD (should be lasting YEARS).I Have bought other LED's and will continue to do so, I just wont buy these.
