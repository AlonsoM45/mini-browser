I took this on a cruise i went on, that Halloween fell on one of the days at sea. Wore a cute black skirt and top, and went as a belly dancer/Egyptian. You use your imagination and there could be many more uses for this. Great quality. NOT CHEAPLY made. I plan on using it in the future as surprising hubby night, all dressed up for anniversary gift. LoL. HIGHLY Recommend for so many uses. Role play? great for that too.
