I had my HTC Incredible 2 for a year now, and after it stopped charging or turning on I opened up the back to find corrosion where the stock battery and phone was connected! I cleaned up the corrosion and went looking for a new battery.This product fit all my needs for a good price, so I placed my order. Delivery was fast and arrived on the exact date it stated, the packaging was compact, the instruction manual was short and simple while telling me everything I needed to know, and it came with a warranty card should I want to activate it. I put the battery in, let my phone charge for about 10 minutes before turning it on, and it was at 85%, so I'm guessing it was pre-charged some. It didn't take long at all to get a full charge which I liked since my old battery even in it's newer days took a lot longer to get that 15%.Overall, great quality, exactly what I was looking for, amazing price, and speedy delivery. If you have a phone that needs this type of battery, get this one. You won't regret it!
