The Price of a Gift is  a super good book!!  The author did a great job with character description and the relationships! As I read I honestly felt like I was there with them. Very easy to follow, I couldn't stop reading! The author draws you in instantly!!  Great read for teens and older!!  I can't wait for the next one Ashley Drake!!!!  THANK YOU!!!
