I only bought this one over the EatSmart Pro because I read some reviews and thought it'd be just as accurate. I got the scale and also bought a calibration weight. This thing never reads it right. Its a 500gram calibration weight and every time I put it on there I get 503, or 505, or 506. I turned it off and on, tare it every time and still get different readings. I tried my friends Eat Smart Pro and it read 500 grams every single time I tried the weight. I thought it was a fluke and tried some other weights of things I already knew and it was always off.I may contact Ozeri to see if its just this unit, but I really don't want something this inaccurate if its not. That or I will return it and buy the Eat Smart Pro and eat the shipping costs.
