I recently moved to a different state on a whim with little money and little clothes, and not being able to drive quite yet where I live now, I've had to resort to online shopping for what I need. Most my clothes are, shall we say, well loved, and I needed a lot of new things. These were absolutely perfect. I will say that yes, the tops unravel fairly easily, and one of the bows come undone, but other than that they fit great and are super comfy.
