I honestly could not put this one down. Well written and enthralling. A brilliant re-imagining of the roles played by characters formerly well known. My only issue with the story is that I have reached the end of this tale. I long to read more of this Robin's life. If I can find a continuation of this tale I will certainly buy it.
