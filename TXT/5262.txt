I was searching for a good zoom lense, I narrowed down my search to 70-300mm and 55-250mm IS II. I did lota reasearch and selected 55-250mm IS IIIS II specificaly coz as the name suggest IS &#34;image stabilization&#34; and I needed it badly since I was not a pro then but after 6 months of use, I say this is the one that I needed. Yes the price, It is resonable for an IS II and I didn't have plans of spending more, otherwise I would have gone for 70-300mm IS.
