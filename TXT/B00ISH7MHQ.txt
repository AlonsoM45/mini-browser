I was amazed by a lot of the information I found in this book. I will actually reference this book in the future, which is not something I can say about a lot of books I have looked at over the years when looking for natural and preventative foods. I didn't give five stars because after only a couple pages I could tell the author is not a native English speaker. Some of the wording set the information of balance and I had to reread to try to figure out what author was trying to say. Not because of spelling errors either. I think Mrs Cooper did an amazing job. The book is full of great information, just please have the book proofread by an English speaking person. I would happily come back and update my review and give five stars.
