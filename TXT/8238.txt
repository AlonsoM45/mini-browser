I, too, bought the $49 starter kit from Home Depot.  Brought it home, put the bulbs in, connected the gateway, and downloaded the app.  After an initial hiccup with the app, I got everything fired up and working.  Support easy to set up bulb names, room names and set scenes.  I ordered five flood lights (br30) to add to the house, and they also work great.  I recommend this system.
