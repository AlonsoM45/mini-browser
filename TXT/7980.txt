I have an AR style buttstock on my Flex 500. This LimbSaver fit perfectly, and it really tamed the recoil on my shotty, even with magnum slugs.  Although...it&#699;s gonna kick no matter what with those!  But...it&#699;s still a lot better than just the plain buttstock pad alone.  I&#699;d definitely recommend to anyone looking to put it on a shotgun!
