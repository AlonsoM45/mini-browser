Starts off really cute. Soft and colorful. But after one washing... fades a lot. After two washings even more. The sheets are now see through. Don't get me wrong it hasn't fallen apart or ripped, but the lack of color fastness is enough to make me wish I had bought a different set, and I had bought two. So if you're getting it for a bed that your not going to wash, go ahead. But you might want a little better quality if you have to wash behind toddler boys.
