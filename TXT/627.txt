Great price for this product. I still use the bassinet part for my 6 month old (since it's so spacious); I still have so much use for it. Don't bother buying another bassinet (I wish I had bought this product first), since my baby grew out of the other bassinet at 6 weeks :(. It was simple to assemble. I recommend this product!
