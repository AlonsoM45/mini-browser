This is the second book of the Confectionatley Yours series that I have read, and I am quite pleased. Teaches on how to never give up, even at the hardest times, and takes the life of Hayley Hicks and turns it into something that girls want to read. It definitely fulfilled my expectations and I am looking forward to reading another Confectionatley Yours book.
