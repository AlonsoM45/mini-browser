This was the best book I have read in a long time.  It was definitely filled with a lot of sex scenes some more detailed than others - but they were all great.  I really liked Rich, Vanessa, and Candy's relationship.  It was a little to Unbelievable at times...but that's what fiction is!  I loved it and can't wait for part two to arrive...
