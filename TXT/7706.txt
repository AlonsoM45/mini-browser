I liked the main character development and the man vs himself aspect. However, the knowledge of weapons was a little sketchy and gas goes bad after a year or so unless you use a stabilizer.  Also the characters had a tendency to start shooting when they should have been quiet, such as when they first went  to rescue the lieutenant. The jumping back and forth in time was well done. It is a good zombie story and I'll definitely be reading the second book
