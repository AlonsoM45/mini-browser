My boyfriend ordered this for me as part of a costume to wear to the local renaissance festival, so I'm reviewing from his account. I'm about 5'9, 125 pounds, wear a size 2-4. The skirt came down to just brushing the tops of my sneakers when I tried it on, so it might be a bit long for women of average or short height. Even though the tag says one size fits all, it fit my hips without falling off or slipping, yet had enough stretch to it to comfortably fit the more full-figured ladies out there without any bothersome pinching, as other reviews have stated.  It was really comfortable and flowy, the brick red color looked great with the peasant blouse I wore, and the slip layer covered all of my assets, despite how sheer it looked in the photos. My only complaint being that the color bled A LOT when first washed and I am now the proud owner of 5 pink shirts and 12 pairs of pink socks.
