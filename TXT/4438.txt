"Sleep Yourself Beautiful" is a very very well thought out book. Not only does it give well informed information as to why sleep is important, but it also is a guaranteed hit. It tells you in detail, why sleep is so important. As well as also let you in on a few secrets as to why sleep will actually make you LOOK and FEEL better as a whole.The book goes into great detail about how the term "beauty sleep" is not just a random catch-phrase. It is a real thing. With health as the prime concern here, it tells you that sleep is necessary if you want to actually look attractive.My favorite chapter in the book was the chapter "What Are The Sleep Triggers" where it actually tells you what the body needs to fall asleep. Coming from a guy with diagnosed sleep issues, this actually hit close to home. We have all had those nights where you simply can't fall asleep, and this chapter actually goes into great detail about how to practically force your body asleep.I write all of this to say, this book is QUALITY. If you are having trouble sleeping, maybe you have been struggling with how your body looks lately, this will give you the confidence that it really is a simple fix, and once you are getting the right amount of healthy sleep, you will not only LOOK great, but you will also be 1000% healthier and might even extend your life!
