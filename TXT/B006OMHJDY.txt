This twisted collection of several creepy horror stories made for a good evening's entertainment. Each story is well written and evocative, with some being more complex than others. One stand out story for me is Jacob's Gift, a very Twilight Zone-esque tale about a young man with special powers. I also liked Rest Stop. I could thoroughly feel the woman's apprehension then terror, and the ending is very effective. My favorite is Code Blue, an emotional story with effective twists and a satisfying ending. Quick and sometimes highly original, these stories make for a fun, worthwhile read.
