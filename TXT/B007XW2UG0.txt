I ordered (Juniors Large, 4 Pack: Magenta/Navy/Plum/Jade) for my 10 year old. She usually wears a size 11 in juniors. She loves the colors and they appear to be well made. They are fairly long which is a plus because she will be wearing these as undershirts. They arrived 2 days before the estimated arrival date. I will be buying these again!
