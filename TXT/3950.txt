This game is a unique one, has a well made storyline that is relevant(UFOs phenomenon) and is not as gloomy and scary as most HO games are nowadays. The game has movie clips with real actors, in which you need to notice which objects appeared in them. It has well created HO scenes as well, graphics are clear and crisp, sounds are good. It is a lengthy game, and has a replay value. The developers of this game did a good job! I recommend this game to all the ones that appreciate the HO genre.
