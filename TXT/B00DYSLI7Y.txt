they are wonderful my son was so excited! he LOVES Thomas. but they are pretty cheaply made. already coming apart at the seam when we opened them.. and the material seems like it will rip easy.. but they get my little one excited and ready for bed time so that's a big plus, but probably wont last very long. (however we have lots of Thomas clothes ((winter hats, gloves, and blankets)) and they all seem like they are cheaply made and come apart at the seems within days..) so I wasn't expecting much better quality, just sew it back myself and it stays together.. so that's why I still give it 4 starts cause I purchased only because Thomas was on them. they look better in person then in the picture and the blue one is nice and fuzzy and warm, the green one is thin so better for warmer nights.
