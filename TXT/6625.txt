Very bad: the problem of this book is that it does contain a lot of symbols in formulas, and many times it doesn't explain their meaning. If there wasn't this problem it was worth 5 stars, but imagine a reader trying to guess what all these symbols mean(for example in Ward shading model). Writing a shader knowing what the symbols mean could be done in 10 minutes, but it takes even a week if you don't know what symbols mean. I guess how can the author think that we magically know what he means with all these symbols, how asinine.
