I already have this cell phone, and just purchased this one for a back-up because the monthly insurance fee for my cell phone was just too much, and by buying this phone as a back-up it will save me lot's of money in the long run.  &#34;I do recommend this cell phone&#34; if you need a solid performer that says &#34;Hello&#34;, and &#34;Yes&#34; it gives you all the other bells & whistles  too, but not the over priced price tag that you would pay at the cell phone service/provider company !JM
