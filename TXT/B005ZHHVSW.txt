I think a majority of the bad reviews I read about these cartridges not fitting may have to do with the model you are fitting them into. I noticed hardly any reviews included the model #. Well, here is mine: MFC-J825DW. I have installed only one black cartridge so far. I will update review to include any subsequent pertinent info. First, the package arrived with only one damaged leaking cartridge, a red one. Next, the plastic film covering the inkjet hole is very hard to remove easily without patience and a small sharp tool. Installation was easy enough, and after just one blank page, it printed well and normally. Bottom line, for the price of just one manufacturer approved replacement cartridge, you get 10. If only 2 of the cartridges work for you, you made your money back. I think the great price is due to these few obstacles. So....&#34;ya spin da wheel, an ya take ya chances&#34;.
