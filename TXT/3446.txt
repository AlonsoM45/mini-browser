I just started reading this, but had to say that I loved the Boy Scout scene with the flipped canoe!Now that I've finished, I can still smile about the canoe, even though the need to shed tears is a more compelling expression of the emotions brought about by Mr. Benjamin's story.  The love shared by the men, and most of the women, transcended time, changes in relationships  and family division.  The author's description of the advent of the AIDS epidemic will definitely lead me to research it further.  Thank you!
