This product was shipped to Amazon very poorly .....  it must have seen the rack track because of the carton it came in.  I only used this bed for 16 nights and a seam ( defective ) started to leak and the bed was going flat.....A lesson to be learned ..... if the packaging has been compromised SEND it back..... It's probably a second or defective and was returned before......Then the deduct $51.00 from the return ...... extreme caution !!!!
