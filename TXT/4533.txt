This collection of six horror stories is entertaining. Turkish Night is a surreal and violent story about belly dancing competitors. Never Leave Me stars a possessive husband and a ghost, with an interesting twist to the ending that I really liked. In The Painted Staircase, a troublemaker on a museum tour gets more than he bargains for. The Colour of Dishonor is a chillingly different kind of historical horror story with a cruelly dishonorable character who finds himself haunted by his sins. I Dived the Pandora is a scary story about a wreck dive gone terribly wrong. Enjoyable collection.
