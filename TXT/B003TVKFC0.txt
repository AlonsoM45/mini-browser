Our twins were born premature at 34 weeks and we have been supplementing their diet from the very beginning.We have tried pretty much every gummy vitamin on the market and I am so thankful we found the Natural Dynamix brand.The flavors are so good that my twins ask for the &#34;treat&#34; a few times throughout the day...we even use the gummy vitamins as a reward for good behavior! The ingredients are natural and perfect for a health conscious parents with picky eaters.I will be trying the other gummy vitamins in this product for sure! Great Value and High Recommend this product!
