I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to provide a safe & secure housing for cats.  it is all the description said it was.  I put it on my front porch.  We had very heavy rain that night.  I checked the inside of the house and it was not wet.  I also bought a self warming pad for the inside ot the house which makes it very warm for the cats.
