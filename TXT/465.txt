so i thought i would buy this because its digital and will give much more approximate weight. one would conclude as they see digital scales at grocery stores when they buy produce or meat. Buy something else. i weight different each time in a span of 5 minutes. Sounds hilarious but its a waste of my money. tried various surfaces, wood, tile, carpet. None helped. you need a calculator to measure your weight. You need to measure atleast 5 times and then take an average. you will really get it right.
