No, the book does not include the access code. You have to purchase one from MyITLab. Mine was 88 bucks. It's still a pretty good price for the book itself though. If you take a course that requires this book then I think you'll like it. It's written to where it's easy to read, there's tons of interesting things to break the monotony of just reading. From what I've seen, none of it's hard to understand.
