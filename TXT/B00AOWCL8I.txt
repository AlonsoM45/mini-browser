I LOVE IT. First, service was amazing! I made these especially for my boyfriend and I, but I got the date wrong on my dog tags so I emailed them right away! Sure thing, they sent me another pair with the right information. Second, the company is so nice and they really do a GREAT job. I cant wait to give the dog tags to my boyfriend. Shipping is great!  YOU WONT REGRET IT!
