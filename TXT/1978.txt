This skirt was very cute.  When I got it, it fit just fine and I didn't have to roll down the waist for good measure.  The material feels very smooth, and the color was a very deep black.  I would have gotten a different color, but I don't buy skirts, so I thought to get something in a more basic color.  The skirt runs a bit shorter than I thought it would, maybe more than a couple of inches above my knees.  I wouldn't wear it out unless I had some shorts underneath, but to dance or do some exercises in, this skirt would be perfect.  I'm definitely going to buy another!
