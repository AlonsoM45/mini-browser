All in all, it was a very good read. It started out as just another &#34;how to&#34; guide, but it very quickly turned into an informative wheelhouse and I was able to set up a few new methods of promoting myself as I read it. I have read a few similar books and they all say the same thing - which isn't much - but Seumas definitely helped me to get a few more platforms going that I wouldn't otherwise have thought about. If you're looking for some good pointers and a guiding hand through the process, this is the book for you!
