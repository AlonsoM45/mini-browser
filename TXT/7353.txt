Five year old belt finally broke so I needed a new one obviously. It was only $11 and columbiana is know for having good quality products. Saw a review that said a size 38 waist only had two inches left once fastened but I'm at 270's 6'2" and there is about four to five inches of excess belt. Very sturdy, holds well, never loosens on me and looks good too. Highly recommend, I will be ordering more of there in the future.
