I wish that we had known about Autism and Aspergers back when I was growing up and I sure wish we had this book. Living Independently is well written and although an easy read Lynne in no way talks 'down' to anyone. I have re-read some parts of this book only because I wanted to commit them to memory. I am very much looking forward to Lynne's next endeavor.
