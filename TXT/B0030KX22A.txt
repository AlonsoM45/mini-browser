I read the reviews for these candles before I purchased them, and was very happy with this product!  I got the last 3 that were available, and now wish I had ordered enough for all our windows.  I was a little skeptical of battery operated candles since I had others in the past where the batteries only lasted a few days at the most.  The candles performed beautifully...stayed on from dusk until dawn from the day I put them out until I took them down a few days after Christmas (15 days).  I put all the batteries in them at the same time, and made sure to follow the directions so that the on/off sensor was facing out.  I also liked that you can choose between a solid light or flickering or off.  I used the flickering glow since we live in an old farmhouse, and they looked just like candles burning in the window!.  We didn't have any other outside lights to combat the nice light from the candles.  The light is abit dim, so if you're looking for something bright white like most Christmas lights, you might not like these, but I loved them! t I took the batteries out when I packed them away until next year to avoid something switching them back on while they're in storage.  I sent the company a message to let me know when more are in stock.  Hope these become available again!
