Ok, so a vlogger recommended this book and it sounded interesting. I read 75% of it in 2 days! Very interesting facts. I don't like this guys writing style. He acts as if he wants to build suspense , but it ended up being confusing and annoying at parts. Also, he leaves some relevant facts unmentioned and unaddressed. He pours an unexpected level of personal opinion into each story, tainting(in my opinion) an otherwise uninformed/unbiased reader's perception.I have my own opinions and have read much on many of his chosen subjects and have my own opinions. That said, some of the information changed my opinions but some only darkened my opinion of the author.I liked the book, though :)
