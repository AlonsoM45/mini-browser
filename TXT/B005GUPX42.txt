This very basic travel bag is much larger than I expected. It comes with a flat bottom insert that makes it easy for packing. Shoes can go in either of zippered sides. I put my phone charger in the front zippered compartment. I believe that it is not airline quality but for road trips it is perfect. It could be more attractive but for the price you can't beat it.
