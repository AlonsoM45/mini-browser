Reading Lance Larsen's poetry in "Erasable Walls" was a refreshing experience especially due to the current literary world being dominated by criticism and novels. Poetry is somewhat of a dying art however Lance Larsen seems to resurrect it through his vivid work. From start to finish, each poem drew me in and allowed me to see the world through a variety of perceptions. In poems like "Lips", it's interesting how Larsen focuses on a child's perception of adults and how the details he notices are tied to the superficiality of his mother. With descriptive language like a "smeared" mouth and "wet looking and waxy" appearance Larsen allows us to step into this child's world and a little bit into our own past. In addition to this, Larsen also illustrates the requirement of children to grow up quickly sometimes, applying adult lenses to the perceptions he creates. In "Lips" near the end of the poem he does this, the child describing the numerous duties and errands of his mother and then saying, "I wanted to save all that, and her." In "February 1922: My Father's Conception" the perception is reversed, an older man reflecting upon youth. As the older man sees two names chalked into a driveway (presumably done by children) he reflects "names mapping the erasable walls of the heart." It is this kind of in depth imagery that Larsen employs that causes his readers to not only recognize his good writing, but cause them also to reflect upon greater issues and themes throughout life. This play-on-perception is a wonderful tool that Larsen uses that really captivated me and caused me to think about the power of perception and how perception can change reality. The poetry in this book was wonderful and if anyone is truly a fan of poetry, then they shall truly enjoy the work within this book.
