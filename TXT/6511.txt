Since this book arrived  not a day has gone by without its pages being turned.  Our three grandboys love it as much as we do and have googled to find out more about many of the trees.  I am using it for inspiration for art quilts and the designs, colours and textures are invaluable.  I would highly recommend it.  It is a very special book indeed.
