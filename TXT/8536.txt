The information presented in this writing is useful and I believe many people starting network marketing business could find something that could help them to start business better. What I didn't like about this is calling it a book. For me it's more like a blog post or a information brochure, but definitely not a book. I missed explanations, more analysis and advises. More examples would helped as well.
