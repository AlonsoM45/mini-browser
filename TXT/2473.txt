What a fun book!  This was a pleasurable read; Chet was a terrific narrator and his perspective gives a whole new level of humor to the story.  I enjoyed it as an action mystery as well-- the plot wasn't obvious, which made it a real page-turner.  Definitely looking forward to reading more in the series.
