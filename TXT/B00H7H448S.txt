Not quite as dark of a red as is shown in this picture. The steering wheel cover would not fit over my steering wheel despite being advertised as &#34;meant for a PT Cruiser&#34;. The set itself was EXTREMELY difficult to assemble and honestly if I could, I wouldn't have bought it in the first place. Just like in the image though, the floor mats are a completely different shade of red and make me wonder why they didn't just pair this set with black. All in all- it was ok for the price, but I would advise against purchasing this set.
