I really like this handle and how it allows the razor to move.Every other handle i've used had razors built in which never allowed it to move with my face.I'm able to get a great grip so I can make sure I have total control which means less cuts.I'd like to say I was lucky enough to try this for free thanks to a program from Gillette.
