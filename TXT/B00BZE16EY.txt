I've been looking for a good military-style peacoat for years, ladies. Years. This coat fits great, but is very snug in the chest. If you have big boobs, go a size up. The shoulders fit perfectly, which is a difficult thing to find, more than one might think. It's the best. The color is the best. Sleeve length is just right.. It nips in juuust enough at the waist. My favorite is the collar's details. The navy on the reverse, the standup-ishness....swoon.Hyperbolically,Juliet
