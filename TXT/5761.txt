After reading this book, I felt empowered! Reading one heart wrenching journey after another made me realize that even in our darkest hours, our family isn't alone in the fight to recover our daughter from the group of illnesses they diagnosed as autism. This book should not only be required reading for anyone who loves a child or adult with autism, but someone who is pregnant or planning on starting a family. NOONE is buying the better diagnosis excuse that the CDC keeps trying to sell. Our children with autism are medically sick and they can get better with the right interventions!
