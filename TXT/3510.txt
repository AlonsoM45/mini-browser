I liked very much the presentation of this product. The protective film is not easy to install but the instructive video on youtube is very handy. When just aplyed it gives a kind of microgranular texture to the display but this dissapears in the next days. I do have, however, one negative oppinion. Since I ordered the full body protective skin, there are several films to aply but not enough instalation solution. Just one small cilinder spray is included. My advise: when buying the full skin please include at least 2 or 3 cilinders of installation solution.
