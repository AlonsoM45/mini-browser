What a bad design. With wet hands and a moving toddler there is no easy way to use this as you have to try and grip the side or bottom. They should have included a handle. Plus, the rubber that is supposed to form around the child's head when you poor is too stiff and water just gets in their eyes anyways. Lastly. when trying to use the sprinkler function unless you poor really slowly the water just runs over the lip. Not much good to say about what should be such a simple product.
