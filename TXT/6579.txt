Really a great read and thankfully not a full on love story. It was pretty well written except a few areas toward the end the paragraphs got a little confusing as to who's side you were reading about. I genuinely enjoyed the fact to that this starts after the wars and doesn't drag you thru anything but the necessary and important ones.
