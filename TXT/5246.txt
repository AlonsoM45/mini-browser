I have been collecting these Southern Living Christmas books since 1995, and this year was just as wonderful as all the rest.  These are my go-to reference books for Christmas decorating, crafts and wonderful recipes for not only entertaining, but family holiday meals. I've found that while I save all my Christmas issues of the magazine, these books are what I always reference because everything I need is here in one volume. I love the complete menus for different holiday meals and entertaining.  The depicted decor is also just lovely, and offers several different ideas from rustic to elegant.  I'm happy to add this 2013 version to my collection.
