This book was interesting on so many levels.  It was a great looking glass into the history of a time that I did not know much about.  (History major, here).  It dispelled many myths I had about that particular century, (i.e. no one ever bathed), and it made me curious enough to explore the Hapsburg family to see how close fact was to fiction.Great read.  Simple and straight forward.
