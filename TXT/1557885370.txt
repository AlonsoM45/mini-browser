This book was written by an author with a TON of experience on the subject. Lots of interesting tidbits of info on how air behaves as it passes through not only the engine, but through both the intake and exhaust systems. The book is a bit math heavy, so it's not written like a typical DIY engine book. It's more of a reference for those who are building engines on the professional level. If you skip most of the math (as I did), the book is pretty easy to read/understand.
