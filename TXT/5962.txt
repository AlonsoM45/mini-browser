After a few months of use, i am finally writing a review for this battery. I still get around 2 days of life on this battery if im lightly using the phone. Heavy use (music and gaming) i get a full day. I must recommend this to everyone who has an electrify or photon, but batteries are like eggs, dont be surprised if you get a bad one.
