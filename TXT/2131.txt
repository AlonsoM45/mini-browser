The Seller did properly describe the trap set tool, as for it's intended use, but it is worthless when trying to set the strong heaver body grip traps like the Duke #280, #330 etc., this devise does work for smaller traps like the Duke #110, but you can set this trap with your hands, so the tool is not needed, in my opinion this tool is near being worthless to use on large body grip traps, for which it was advertised to set, again it does work to set the small, maybe to medium size traps, but again, I just don't trust it for setting larger traps like the Duke #280, or #330 sizes, my reason for thinking this is that the handles on this set tool are to short, and you can't get enough leverage to easily, or safely set the large traps (the tool only measures 20 inches long), and too, I don't trust the small pivot bolt that connects each half of the tools steel handles together, it does not appear to be made of case hardened steel, and under heavy pressure I think it might break, and may cause injury to the user, but it's just my opinion, and other peoples opinions may differ.  The price was right, but in my opinion the tool is almost worthless to set large traps, and again, just not sure about the safety aspect, or quality issues of this tool.
