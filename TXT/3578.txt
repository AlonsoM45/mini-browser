This book is extremely helpful in understanding in a compassionate way the Insider Movement, and yet revealing the fundamental flaws in the movement.  I appreciated the overall tone of the book, which is not blasting the attitude of the insider movement, but demonstrating that the movement is attractive but unbiblical and fails to lead to strong Christians among Muslims.  There is a basic fallacy in theology in the Insider Movement that is clearly demonstrated.  This spills over into translations which have been creating major problems in a number of Muslim countries.
