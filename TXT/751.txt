I recently received this razor for free from Gillette to try and I must say it is amazing. The handle is very durable and solid and it has the perfect shape. It does not constantly fall out of my hand while shaving. It will certainly not break unlike the cheap dollar store razors that I was using. I would recommend you try this great razor.
