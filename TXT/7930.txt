I should have known better than to go with anything else but! I originally had ordered the GoGroove BasePulse 2MX speakers mainly for the blue lights. Immediately they crackled and skipped. So I returned them and ordered these. They are AWESOME! For little speakers they have awesome sound and are &#34;wicked&#34; loud at less than half volume. And only $10 more than the others. These also didn't crackle or skip a beat. Very happy with this purchase.
