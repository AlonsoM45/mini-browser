Have been buying this brand for 20 years and the product keeps getting better.  We love this mattress pad and it's new design.  The plug-in is at the head of the bed (rather than at the foot), and each side has it's own circuit (rather than wired in parallel).  The plug in is on the vertical side (rather than on top, like many other brands), so it is out of sight and feeling.Can't feel the heating wires at all.  Agree with others that the highest setting (10) is WAY too warm, but you will soon learn what works for you.  My husband heats up his side on 4, while I use a toastier 7-8 setting.  Within 10 minutes of being in bed, I usually shut it off, as my body heat is enough to keep me comfortable.This is a really good investment and I highly recommend it.  No drawbacks at all.
