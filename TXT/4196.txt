Before I bought this, I decided to do a &#34;DIY Z Palette&#34; and I was so excited to make one but it didn't turn out as sturdy as I wanted it too so I just ended up buying this. Really happy that I purchased this. I use these for my MAC & makeupgeek eyeshadows/ MAC blushes. I wish it was just a little more sleek though but whatevs.
