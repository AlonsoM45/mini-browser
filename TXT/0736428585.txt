My 3 year old daughter loves this book! We borrowed it from our library, but she did not want to return it! I had to buy her a copy for herself, since she enjoys reading and she LOVES the CARS movies. Before the book came in the mail,  I convinced her to let the borrowed one go by explaining how other children would not be able to enjoy the pleasure of reading the book if she kept it. The next day, hers showed up in the mail! Awesome
