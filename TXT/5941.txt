Searcy's book, &#34;Connect&#34; is a good book and I really enjoyed it, for the simple reason it enabled me to start thinking through how to create and implement systems in our church. What I like about it is that its very practical. While not everything translates to our context, I always make sure I look for principles of connection not programs. And very often with Searcy, what you see is simply common sense put to print helping us remove much of the fear of recruiting and implementing volunteers.
