The Sightron SIII has the clarity, resolution, edge-to-edge sharpness, and color accuracy to match scopes costing twice as much.  The ranging data provided with the scope makes range estimation and target sizing simple.  And the 50X magnification allows very precise aim out to 1000 yards.  The old rule applies, "You can't hit what you can't see.", and with the Sightron SIII, seeing your target is no problem.
