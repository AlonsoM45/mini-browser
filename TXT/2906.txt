When I first bought my house in 2007. I hated the two colored gray and blue tiles in the bathroom due to plumbing repair prior to me buying the house not to mention the folding shower door. Yes apparently they made folding shower doors almost 60 years ago. So, I took down the shower door but I did not rip out the old tiles as they were in good shape. They don't make stuff like they used to and a bathroom renovation was not in my budget. I can only examine the cost of demolition of an old bathroom. My brother put this on the tiles which were about four feet or more up the walls of the entire bathroom and higher around the tub. It looks like a new bathroom.  The only difficult part was getting a smooth finish and coverage. He used a small roller at first that didn't give a smooth finish, but I had to buy another and there person at the home improvement store suggested covers that produce a smooth finish. I probably will order another kit, because as it dries you will see areas that don't have enough coverage and the touch kit is too small to cover those areas. Beware of the odor. It is very strong even after application for days. I had this done when my five year old was staying with Granny for winter break.
