I love this product.  A friend recommended it and promised I would see a difference in my nails after one month.  Boy! Was she ever right.  It did not let me down.  I followed the directions from Nail Tek, and it did make my nails much stronger.  I noticed a difference in my right hand in about two weeks and after a month both hands look great.  Everyone wants to know what I have done to get them so long and strong.  I tell them, &#34;Nail Tek.&#34;  It has been 2 months now and I have yet to break a nail.  Thanks Nail Tek and thanks to my friend.
