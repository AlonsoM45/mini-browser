I specifically ordered this firebowl because it was advertized as a 35 inch firebowl. After receiving it in the mail, the bowl only measured 22 inches. It was too late to swap it out because I was having a party that night and couldn't order another in time. That's false advertizing and it needs to be fixed immediately.
