I have already read V.A. Stuart's- The Sepoy Mutiny, The Cannons of Lucknow, The Heroic Garrison and The Valiant Sailors which I have enjoyed.The Vistors and Lords became a bit tedious especally in the early chapters.  I would give it a 2 star rating.  I am looking forward to reding Massacre at Cownpore..
