Very nice book. One thing lacking...how to make suet. Love the extra info in this book. Great info for habitat and landscaping preferences for the birds as well as high of the bird feeders, the types of feeders, and even how to make a feeder. All very wonderful additions to a fun book of recipes for bid food. Except that most of the recipes call for suet and the book lacks a basic suet recipe. I can google that and the book still had valuable info.
