Amazon prime offers this video for free for viewing on PC and I have been wanting to get in shape so I took advantage of the free aspect of it!I am NOT in shape, a good 100+ pounds overweight, I dont go on walks, I dont do anything to get me moving through the day so I was scared to start in on Jillian but I am glad I did. This is great for beginners. There were some things I couldn't do, but I just kept moving with some of the warm ups/easier exercises while they did the ones I couldn't do. I got through 17 minutes before I had to call it quits, which may not be great for those experienced in working out, but for the first time working out since gym in high school, I felt AWESOME and felt very accomplished getting through nearly half of it! I cant wait to see how long I can go tomorrow!
