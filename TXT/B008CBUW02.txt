Awesome tablet!  Works great and carries all the needed programs that I use!  The keyborad has the USB port and I recenly found a mini USB flash drive at best buy. Or Amamzon sells the adapter which is real nice too. The 32 gig memory is good enough for me as well as &#34;MY CLOUD &#34; file storage supported by ASUS. The only drawback is the camera is really only good outdoors (no flash). Got my tablet overnight via Fed Ex.
