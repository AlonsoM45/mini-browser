This book was a gift so I couldn't really check it out in great detail. Anyway, I am a german living in the states and what made me buy this book and not any other one was because most of the other &#34;german cookbooks&#34; on amazon were written by americans inspired by german cuisine, or &#34;americanized german recipes&#34;.This book was written by germans living in Germany and claims itself &#34;not americanized&#34;!Since it was a gift I didn't really have a lot of time to check it out in great detail but briefly looking through it I think this was a good choice!
