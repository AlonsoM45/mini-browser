Very good science fiction movie, with beautiful effects and great acting! Of course, many scenes were made with a lot of help of computer and graphics, but that's the beauty of using the technology to create something great. I personally expected some more deep story line. For me it was similar like The Matrix. Just in The Matrix human's don't even realize there was a war and in Oblivion they believe they have won the war but they have to leave..One of the things that really mesmerised me was the house where the main characters were living. Amazing house with even more amazing pool. I wish to have such living place for myself:)This movie raised me a question about what we believe to be true. Do we really know that something is true or we are just taking the things other people or authorities are telling us and considering them to be true? As you'll see in the movie, there is no true, there is just a created reality we are living in. Even though the scenes in the movie are science fictional, the concept of human life is a reality which is happening around you every day just in different forms.
