I wasn&#699;t sure if this light was going to be bright enough...but it&#699;s PLENTY bright!  I use this LED bar on the top of my light bar tripod...and I hang a vertigo and Revo Rave under it... and it&#699;s perfect.  I&#699;ll probably end up buying a 2nd Mega Pixel LED bar, and use two of them linked master/slave and run those on my truss. This ONE bar will light up a medium sized room all by itself.
