Bought these at Wal-Mart the other night. They seemed like they'd be pretty cool, but instantly had the black plastic piece on the smaller knife fall off on me. Easy fix but they could have put more effort in securing that piece down besides a single strip of (barely adhesive) glue on the back side. Then, the next day I had the screws strip out on the belt clip on the larger knife. Keep in mind I hadn't used these knives at all except to clip onto my trucks headvisor. You get why you pay for. Other than that, the blades on both knives are very sharp! And the belt cutter and the glass breaker are definitely a great add on (main reason I bought this set)!
