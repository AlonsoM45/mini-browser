Fell in love with the royal blue dress but the top is cut very low. There were no Crystal-like beads anywhere on the dress that i received.  I was actually looking forward to a little beading, but it is still nice without it.Be careful of the neckline, if you are anything more than an A cup.  The &#34;Girls&#34;  will be quite exposed.  I am a C cup, so I took the dress to a dress maker to see if she could add about 2&#34; to the top for more coverage.
