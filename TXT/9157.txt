I've never written a review before but I had to for this book because it was literally so horrible. I had seen some quotes from it that seemed so beautiful that I just had to read it -- and there were some great quotes, but they were obscured by the rest of this monstrosity of horrible-ness. The characters are extremely underdeveloped and two-dimensional. Sutter is this raging alcoholic who doesn't feel anything as much as he says he does. I feel like his motto of embracing the now is a total sham, because although he says to live in the moment ten million times, he's just going through the actions. Getting drunk and going to parties and talking to attractive women...this doesn't mean you are always living spectacularly. Not if it means shoving your actual feelings into a deep dark hole and not caring about anyone who loves you. Then there's Aimee, who I feel has so much potential but instead is a character who Sutter simply uses and corrupts. Sutter keeps saying he wants to show Aimee she can be her own person and that she doesn't have to be trodden on by her family, but then Sutter goes ahead and stomps all over her. I didn't like the writing style of Tharp much either. It never quite flowed well for me.
