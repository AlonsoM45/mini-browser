I bought this for my boyfriend and I's one year for him. He loves it as do I. I am thinking about getting myself one. It is kind of big but the sizes are correct for 4 X 6 pictures. I would recemmond this to anyone that needs a gift idea or something just to hang in there house. You HAVE to hang it on a wall. It will not just sit up some where. Its adorable and I love it.
