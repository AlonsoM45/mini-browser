The feel and fit of the case was good, except that the microphone opening is in the wrong side and covers the mic.  with the case on, nobody can hear you, and also; to make it worse; if some of you wonder what is that small hole on the top of the F7 phone? Well, that is a secondary microphone with a noise reduction system, and of course, the case covers that mic also. Since it was cheap, I just opened the holes for the microphones with scissors, and for some other supernatural reason, everybody that I tried to talk to told me that they could not hear me, after removing the case, they could hear me ok...
