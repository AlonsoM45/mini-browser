This is the best book that I have read in two months and I read a lot. As a matter of fact this is the first book I have been inspired to write a review for. First of all I'm pretty savvy at figuring out the plots to these stories and although I was on the right track I didn't see it going exactly  the way it did. This book was incredibly intriguing, it kept me interested at every turn, I read it straight threw. Would love to read his POV. I don't put my stamp of approval on just anything but I will be sharing this author's work.
