The battery, though a higher mA rating than the one that came with the camcorder, doesn't last as long. The charger gets points for accepting 12v DC and 110v AC power sources. The large tripod is a terrible, terrible joke. Even the tiny Sony HDR camcorder was too much for it and the storage bag tore the first (and last) time I used it. The tiny tripod appears to be a child's toy; placing any weight on the supposedly positionable legs causes them to buckle, unevenly, meaning you cannot aim the camera in any direction reliably. The mounting device broke the first (and last) time I used it. The SD card is fine, as is the USB adapter for the card. The bag, however, is much too small to carry even half of these accessories along with a camera of any size, and both side zippers pop open with even the slightest pressure. I have to assume the bag was meant to be a method for storing tripods during their trip to the garbage. At least that's what I used it for.
