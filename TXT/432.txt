I have always been terrified about cancer.  Mr. Martin took the fear away when he forced me to stand by him and go through very detailed descriptions of the treatments and outcome of those treatments.  Although I was not in the room with him, his writing made me feel as though I was there in the treatment room with him.  I sat down in early evening and started reading. It got later and later but I could not leave Mr. Martin alone.  Even though my insides were shaking and tears were running down my face, I knew I had to keep reading and learning and supporting Mr. Martin. This book is truly a must read for people who felt like I did about cancer.  After experiencing life with cancer through Mr. Martin's eyes, I know I can beat it.  I am no longer as afraid and I once was and I commend Mr. Martin for his courage to share all the most personal intimate details of this horrific trip he took to beat cancer.  With the knowledge he shares in this book, it will help you in your battle with cancer. Thank You Mr. Martin.
