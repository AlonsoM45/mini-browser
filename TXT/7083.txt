This book grabs one from the beginning in typical &#34;Picoult&#34; fashion.  It took me quite some time to figure out the weaving of the myth, and to separate it from the reality of the horror of the Holocaust.  The emotional roller coaster was constant throughout the book, and created deep seated emotions in me.In the end, it all came together in a most unexpected way.  But when I considered the full &#34;story&#34;, it made perfect sense.  One of the best books I have read in a long, long time.
