What is all the hype about? This is a perfect example of &#34;the emperor's new clothes:&#34; there really is nothing there. There is no substantive script, and no space (sic) for real acting. The special effects are boring and vertigo-inducing: stuff keeps spinning around and Bullock's primary contribution is panting like she is in labor. The events are so far-fetched and illogical they further minimize an already minimal experience. What a disappointment. She and the movie were both nominated for oscars; somebody must have lobbied hard and long.
