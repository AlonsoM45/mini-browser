I purchased this because of reviews on this and similar products. I bought it used since I don't really care about the look of a book as long a s its reasonably useable. The seller I chose for ratings as well, and they gave themselves a large window for delivery,  but it came at their earliest projected date. That said, the book was in gently used condition. I've only just started to read it and so perhaps I may come back and provide a more in-depth look at its content and  information quality.
