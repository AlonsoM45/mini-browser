This book is exactly what has been missing for leadership in churches around the world.I read the whole book in the duration of one flight, and I finished feeling encouraged and agreeing 100%.I've known and admired the ministry of Benny Perez for many years now, and this book captures his heart and energy perfectly.The ideas and concepts in this manuscript are spot on to what I believe the spirit of God is saying to this generation while also respecting and embracing the practicalunderstandings of the 21rst century.I'd recommend this book to anyone in leadership looking for the perfect balance for the day we live in.Wonderful book!
