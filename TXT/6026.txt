I bought this lamp for my acrylic work, I'm super happy because the price was very good, with free delivery, all you pay a tax, but I get ahead of schedule, very well packed, and in good condition, I look elsewhere and had it for a higher price, dries fast, and I like that does not occupy much space and has a fairly long power cord, my friends liked it, I highly recommend it, the transaction was clear and very fast, and they sent me an email notifying me the update, and hope to make another purchase in the future with the seller.
