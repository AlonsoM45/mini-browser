This is the cheapest place to get this product by far :) I decided to try this product to help with my dogs fatty tumors, at the advice of my friend. Gave him 1oz per day. After several weeks, the tumors started to shrink! There was a significant reduction in size. They went from a softball size to around golfball size. Then after a cpl months, the tumors started to grow back. :(  They returned to their original size. I may try the gel in addition to the neutralizer and see if that helps. It was very amazing how they shrunk, even if only for a while.
