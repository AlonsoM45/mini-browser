This book seemed to start off good...but I just had a real problem with the characters. The sex scenes were just as good as book one...if not better.  It was something with those characters that I just didn't like this time around.  Once I got  in I read the last chapter because I didn't want to invest too much time into these characters.  While it was OK...it had the potential to be so much better.  I think Book II was the darker version of the, oh so sweet Book I.
