Outfit arrived very promptly but was very disappointed in the lame' cat appique. To me it made the outfit look cheap. Cute outfit if the applique was't that Gold Lame' Stuff. It rjuined it for me.I gave this a 2 star rating because of the applique and the fact that the return date was only 10 days from date of receipt. My fault I guess for not really looking at the outfit when it 1st arrived.
