This now my 'go to' book regarding anything about the afterlife. Containing information in sequence regarding the stages we go on to experience after death; with personalised examples collected from many case histories. If you had to recommend 1 book to someone who wanted answers to what happens behind the veil - this is the book! It has inspired me to make some life changes.Its also the only book my husband has allowed me to read out to him - so it must be good! Highly recommended
