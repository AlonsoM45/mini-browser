Ok so I gave this 4 stars only because I ran out of bluing to finish my project.  It&#699;s a GOOD DECENT product, so good as a matter of fact that I bought a second kit, as well as an extra bottle of &#34;Super Blue&#34; along with it. My only complaint is that I ran out of bluing.With that being said...I&#699;d recommend it to anyone looking to re-blue their gun.  Just be sure to buy another container of Super Blue. I think that works better than the Perma Blue they send in the package.I used this kit to re-blue a Mosin Nagant rifle.  The blue and rust remover worked incredibly well.  Degreaser was ok...I used brake cleaner and then wiped it all down with the degreaser, so I only used just a little bit.  The tru oil was good too.  I didn&#699;t use the stain at all, but I will on my next project gun. And I didn&#699;t use the wood conditioner either.  Instead I sanded the old finish off my gun, then used about 6 coats of the tru oil, and finished that off with about 6-8 coats of wood wax.  That worked out well.It was actually easier than I expected. Just take your time, and be ready for the smell!  Make sure you do this in a well ventilated area.  I did it in my garage, with the door open.  If you&#699;ve been thinking about re-bluing your gun...go ahead and buy this kit and do it.  This kit makes it easy.
