I've been a big fan of the codeword puzzles in crossword books. This version takes all the drudgework  out of guessing letters, filling each blank and erasing them all if they're incorrect. My only criticism of the game is that it is possibly too easy to complete, since you can check your answers at any point in the game. I'm going to purchase the unlimited version as soon as my free games run out!
