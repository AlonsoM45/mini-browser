This is one of my favorite series, it has all, creativity, excitement, its funny, it has something mysterious of how its going to end and it always keeps you guessing. It came in a great shape like the seller told of it. I got it pretty quick too. It was really worth every cent I put in.  I would advise this series to any science fiction movie lover and I think it even has a kind of criminal sight there too if you like crimes. Well I choose out of all these things to give 5 stars.
