This is a CD I order for an upcoming Birthday for my sister born in 45. The CD was sent quickly to me. I ordered and pay for a new CD and it was not wrapped as a new CD should be. Given that I played it, it did played well I really liked the songs. I will keep it for myself and possibly order another for my sister when her Birthday comes up. Why wasn't this CD wrapped as all new CD,s are?
