I haven't finished this book yet, but so far I'm enjoying it very much.  Very well-written, and very thought provoking.  I love historical novels anyway, and this subject matter is interesting...former slaves who now own slaves.  A good book, to me, is one that has good character development so that you care about and want to learn more about them.  This does that for me, and I'm looking forward to sharing their journey.  I would recommend it to any historical novel reader like myself.
