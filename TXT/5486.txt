Thanks for having a big box of these all in one place and easily shipped to my home. I don't get out too often, and when i Do, i hate hunting for a bargain on batteries. These AAA are called for in almost all my remotes, and indoor/outdoor thermometers. I use them in my uv/light toothbrush cleanser, flashlight, and on and on. Wonderful purchase. Thanks for the ease in obtaining.
