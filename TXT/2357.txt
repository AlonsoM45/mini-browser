Attack of the Customers will help anyone trying to anticipate or defend a customer attack delivered/fueled through social media. Especially useful in large-scale product/service organizations with public brands that are worth defending and protecting.Attack of the Customers is approachable reading, with stories that will either be familiar or relevant throughout. Gillin and Gianforte view what were high-profile PR crises through the lens of history, and focus instead on how social media was relevant to those events. For example, the beef industry's lack of preparedness for the "pink slime" incident, where consumer outrage over the industry's practice of using "lean finely-textured beef" to make processed foods boiled over, is surprising in hindsight.Brand managers especially will find Attack of the Customers useful in identifying strategies for dealing with the four phases of an attack, the eight steps that the authors recommend for preparing a policy and strategy for attacks, and how brand loyalty (or disloyalty) play a major role in both reach and amplification of customer attacks.
