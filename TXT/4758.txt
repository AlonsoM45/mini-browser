Please don't make the mistake I did and buy these thinking that you are getting a good deal...you are NOT. I have never had a problem with dual layer dvd+r disks before, so I also made the mistake of not reading any reviews.I bought the 50 disk spindle (DR8S8B50F/17). So far I have burned through 23 disks with 4 successful writes using DL.These disks have a problem when trying to write to the second layer as they all error at 50%; they will not continue to write. Burning a file a single layer size results in 100% success (I have done this on about 10 disks so far). So instead of a good deal on dl disks, these are rather expensive single layer dvd + r disks.Other info:I use ImgBurn (always have, always will). I have used dl media from Sony, Memorex, and mostly Verbatim with absolutely no errors (unless it was something I caused). I only bought the Philips because they were on sale and I'm always willing to try out new alternatives.I have tried on 3 seperate burners (Sony, LG, Pioneer)...same result (from 4x-8x)I am not going to accept the 'this is a bad batch' nonsense as there should be some sort of QC in place to prevent that.Ultimately, this product is a waste of money. I will never buy anything with the Philips brand again. As has been said time and time again you are better off buying the more (slightly more) expensive disks...
