This is a decent cooler for its price but it could be so much better.1. Construction - As most other reviewers have stated, the construction is flimsy at best and heavy mobile use will eventually lead to an accident. Also the metal &#34;incline&#34; bar likes to pop out of slot sometimes wich is bad for the laptop. Also, the unit needs to be propped up on 4 &#34;legs&#34; (i use small square wooden blocks at each corner&#34; to actually get a decent airflow from the bottom.2. Fan - The fan is big, but it doesnt turn fast at all even at max. And it doesnt push that much air to your laptop. After a month of use, i can only get a 2 or 3 degree drop in CPU temperature and a 5 - 10 degree drop on VGA and HDD from this unit.3. Lighting - The red LED is nice and is the main reason i ordered this unit. I thought it would compliment my red backlit keyboard and red lights that i use to operate my computers in the dark. Well i was wrong. The LED is %100 invisible when you have a laptop sitting on the unit, and therefore is of no use at all.4. Size - This unit is advertised to fit 17&#34; inch Laptops. Good luck getting a 15&#34; inch to fit good on it. This unit is for Android Tablets and netbooks when it comes to size.5 - Conclusion - Do not buy! There has to be better products out there for the same price. If your set on a red LED laptop cooler, forget it because very very few Cooler LED's are visible once a laptop is sat on them. Thermaltake kicks ass just not at Laptop Coolers yet.
