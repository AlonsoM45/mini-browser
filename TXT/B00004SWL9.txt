Simply put, this game will make someone extremely happy to own.  However, as far as graphics and gameplay, I could pass up on it.  Still, this game would be terrific to watch someone else play, and it came in the case and all.  As always I'm a fan of original casing. So, although I don't care for these early models of fighting games, it works out okay.  Ultimately I was addicted to SNES Street Fighter, so I can't help but be a little unimpressed.  Still, it's a good game and recommended.
