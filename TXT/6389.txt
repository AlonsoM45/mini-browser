I purchased this for my 80-year-old father so he could wear it 24/7 (takes blood thinner). He has almost lost it several times as the clasp keeps coming open and the bracelet slips off. Most times, he doesn't even know he's lost it. I had a jeweler tighten the clasp as much as they could but it still catches on things which pulls the clasp open.  A better, more secure clasp would give this bracelet 5 stars as it is very attractive and a good solid weight.
