Ever noticed that sitting in the seat in the bus which takes you to work and doing this same exercise for 10 years doesn't give you that feeling of what you really wish to do in life? Being an excellent accountant at a big company and making a lot of money doesn't bring you joy? Always wanted travel the world but are stuck in a well paid job that doesn't give you this luxury?You are missing your WHAT!!!But there is an excellent solution to this..The book I've been looking for some time. And you know why? Because I believe that everything in life starts from finding your purpose, your WHAT, your passion engine that really drives you. I've read couple of great books that can help you to find your WHAT, but this one I like particularly because all this book is about it. Steve Olsher is a brilliant author who dedicated all the book to help you find your WHAT, make sure of it and use it to create life you desire.What I like a lot about this book is that everything is distinguished in very understandable order. Moreover, the book encourages you to act right now by having all those exercises that helps in finding your WHAT and using it. That is very important for me, because it really makes you use the knowledge you get. The book is like a guide to your real potential. Of course it will help only under the condition that you will be accurately doing all the exercises. I already have my WHAT, but still it was very worth to do the exercises to check on them.All the examples presented at the end of each chapter are really inspiring and instructive. You can discover a lot of inspiring and brilliant personalities and you can use their knowledge and work to improve yourself even more. Reading this book is not the end, it's just a beginning of your real life's journey. So, make yourself a favor and take time to yourself, discover your WHAT, learn to use it, develop the talents needed and live the life when holidays never end!Looking forward to hear your story of WHAT!
