So I bought this for my T25 with high hopes.  I've been extremely happy with my T25 as well as my M20 Warrior flashlights.  My M20 is mounted to my AR, but the T25 I've been using as a hand held for night &#34;ops&#34; (ok it's not really op's....just night boar hunting!)  The green filter actually works great.  I like it a lot.  But I don't like the FIT of the filter on my T25.  It's on..but comes off VERY easily.  As one of the other reviewers stated, only the very top of the inside of the filter is what holds it to the flashlight. I wish it stayed on a little tighter.  I'm giving it 3 stars because it's not a bad product overall, as I said the filter part is good.  It's just that I'm afraid I'm going to lose this thing in the bush one night.My fix: I have a roll of 1/2 inch black gaffer's tape that I strapped around the bottom of the filter, and taped it to my T25.  So far it works.  I haven't been in the rain yet...so we'll see.  Another idea I have is to put a rubber band thru the lanyard hole and run that thru the clip, so hopefully if the filter falls off, it's still attached to the light.
