This was a very disturbing book. I know BATF guys that were involved in the Waco debacle. They are decent guys. However, I do understand the main character wanting his pound of flesh. While freedom is free keeping it isn't. The main character and his pain, could be any gun owner in America, but he has the ability to extract a price for something that should rarely, if ever happen in a "free" country. On a side note, the spelling needs to be fixed but the spelling Nazis made some spelling errors when they criticized TJ. CMU (Cracked Me Up).  It saddens me deeply to know this is no longer fringe thinking in our country.
