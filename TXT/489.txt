I purchased this case as it was one of the few cases I could find that was both matte and red.  The case is very slim and adds barely any thickness to the device.  I keep an extra battery in my wallet and am often swapping out the battery once it dies.  After about a dozen times or so I noticed a small crack coming from the top-right corner of the case.  The case is a very tight fit that requires a bit of force to remove from the phone.  However, not everyone has multiple batteries for their S4.  For those of you who don't change the battery, this case is just fine.
