Needed this for a 2001 Mercury Sable. I called the dealership and they said one remote was $60. I bought two for $22.97. Both arrived on time and feel very sturdy so far, but it is only the first day. The instructions were the same as what was listed in my owners manual and both remotes programmed easily. I hope they work for awhile. Overall great purchase, especially for the money.
