Years ago, I found this beauty. The independent ratings spoke volumes, and not one was even remotely negative. I purchased one, absolutely love it - it is spectacular in person and the mother of pearl dial is exquisite!!  Now that I was able to get it at a slightly discounted rate, I purchased two more - one that I already gave as a gift to someone who lamented that she had the very same one and lost it - and was mourning it ever since. Well, now she has it back again, and she actually started to cry after she opened the box and saw what was inside. It was definitely my best gift-giving yet!!If you are lucky enough to still be able to purchase this gem, don't let it go. You will NOT be disappointed. The photo does not show it justice.
