This is just the coolest little gadget!Very sleek and gets a lot of attention. I don't mind the attention since I love promoting products that I like. Helping me to lose weight and doubles as a watch (which is great so I don't have to pull my phone out to check the time when I am exercising). If I want to hide it, there is a magnetic feature where I can put it a non-obvious place. Im excited to have a product that helps me understand my sleep and activity levels. I love the topaz color and it looks great with the tan/leather watch band that I also purchased. Overall its very versatile and a great product. Would definitely recommend for someone who is trying to get back into shape or concerned with their health. Another thing I was really pleased with is that the customer support got back to me on a sunday night! (just had some questions)
