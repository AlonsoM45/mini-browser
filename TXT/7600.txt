This is a story of an alpha wolf and his fated mate Lily. This is a great story about new adults finding love and the challenges of becoming the Alpha and protecting the Pack. It is a very exciting set of books that tell their stories and it takes you on one wild ride after another. There is a lot of fighting and mystery along with love making in a very tasty way.  The author is as always written a very great set of books so good that I bought all of them a while back ago.  She also gifted me this set for a honest review.  So I read them again so I could give this review and they are as good as they were the first time.
