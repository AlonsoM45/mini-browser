My kids and I loved this book! It's packed with lots of humor and a fun story line. We kept turning the pages, laughing much of the way. We want to buy the next few books in the series. Who doesn't want more joy and laughter in life?In addition to the humor, we appreciate how Beamer, Bash's cousin, grows from his cousin's influence; albeit he does protest the stretching like most of us do. One can't help feel sorry for the aunt's nervous tick developed I'm sure from this zany bunch.We highly recommend Bash and the Pirate Pig!Posted by Michelle and Patrick Welsh family
