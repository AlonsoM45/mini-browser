I received these razor blades for free via a program run by Gillette. That being said there are the best razors ever. I thought the standard 5 blade cartridge provided me with the best Razor blade shaving experience I have ever tried UNTIL I tried the Power version my opinion these are closest, most comfortable blades available today. These blades are very good and last me 3 weeks with a thick beard. I shave my beard and also my head and my skin is smooth and soft.
