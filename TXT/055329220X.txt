I first read this book well over 20 years ago, so it must have been the original version.  I was young and foolish then (even more so than now! LOL) and I still remember how appalled I was that a woman should shake her curls at her husband, pound her fists on his chest, and have a hissy fit so she could get her way.  How juvenile!  And I suppose I should try that tactic on my employer, the person who serves me in a restaurant, my neighbors, speaking with my child's teacher, etc.  I'd soon be "under observation" somewhere for my bizarre behavior, I'm sure.  I would never EVER recommend this book.
