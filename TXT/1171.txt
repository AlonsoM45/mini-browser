The phone worked well initially but started giving issues after a month, After placing a call I couldnt hear anyone on the other side while they could hear everything that I spoke, I initially thought this is a problem with my telephone subscriber and not with the instrument and went from pillar to post to get this sorted but unfortunately it turned to be a instrument fault. I am outside the returns window and  need to loosen my pockets on another instrument :(
