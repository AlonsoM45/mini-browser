I am very disappointed because of the length of this item. The width is perfect but it is so short I will probably never wear it. The material is great but unless you are into belly shirts I wouldn't suggest it. I am 5'5&#34; and weigh 140. was thinking it would be perfect but it isn't. Too bad because well made and super cute
