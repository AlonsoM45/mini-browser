I bought this game for my husband as a Christmas gift for two reasons: He loves (and I mean LOVES) Monopoly, and he loves Nintendo. Well, needless to say, he LOVED this game!! We ended up playing this game together almost immediately after he unwrapped it and it was great to see the classic Nintendo games represented on the board as well as the little character pieces.
