I rock out to this all the time! I may be a dinosaur but I still love having the actual CD in my hands. I like the process of downloading it and uploading it and then I can still take it with me in the car- without having to upload my iPod. There are a few songs that I don't love but nothing that I can't stand, I'm happy! And the other songs I LOVE!!! Thank you!
