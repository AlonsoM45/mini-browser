I read some reviews that said it's comparable to the otterbox, and it is absolutely not!  If your talking on the phone for more then a minute the extremely hard plastic part over the camera hurts. Whoever compared it to an otterbox has obviously never owned one, they might be expensive but they are well worth the money. This one I paid under $5 for it and it was not even worth that much.
