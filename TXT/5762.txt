Great case works well, the only problem you might have with it is that it can be hard to take off, once you put it on. But if you keep the pry tool it is not a problem. Kickstand feels a little flimsy, but I've had no problems with it(I open and shut it all day long). Also it comes in a lot of colors schemes
