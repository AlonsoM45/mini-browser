I'm looking to get a cheap retractable razor to open packages because i'm not strong enough (like my husband) to just rip the packages/carton boxes open.It works well, the blade is so sharp and i can just snap the tip if it gets dull.For a set of 3 knife set, the price is good too.Overall i'm happy with this purchase.
