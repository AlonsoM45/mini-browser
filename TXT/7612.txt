These little shoe socks are the BEST of the bunch, and I have tried them all.  The fabric is lightweight and fits easily under dress shoes.  They don't slip around at all.  I own 8 pairs of them in a variety of colors.  Just wish they were easier to find.  A major bonus-they are made of cotton, not nylon.
