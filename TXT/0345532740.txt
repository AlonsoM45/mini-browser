The story was cute, semi-predictable.  The low rating is due to the ending. I honestly didn't see it coming, not in the twist of a story kind of way but that it just ended.  I felt like the ending came out of nowhere. I actually went back a page to make sure I didn't somehow skip to the end or something.
