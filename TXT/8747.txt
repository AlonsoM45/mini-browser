Mrs. Whitten read The Phantom Tollbooth to my fifth grade class about forty years ago.  I moved before hearing the ending.  The only thing I remembered from the story was the Island of Conclusion.  At the time, I didn't know what "jumping to conclusion" meant, but it got stuck in my memory.The Phantom Tollbooth is as fun to read at fifty years of age as it was to hear it read to me in the fifth grade.  I can appreciate it's educational value now which was lost on me as a child.  The story is a light and easy read with not so subtle reference to numbers, letters, time, character building, and more.
