I would highly recommend this book, especially to any who knows what it is like to pick cotton, or knows someone who has picked cotton. As a boy,  my father picked cotton and I could see him being as curious and mischievous as Luke.  My father also taught me to love Cardinal baseball, and of course Mr. Musical. The references to both were nostalgic and really took me back to childhood days.
