I'm sorry but this movie was horrible. i can't believe i actually sat through the whole thing. The acting was bad, the plot sucked, and nobody actually knew how to play the guitar. I'll give it this, some of the humor was good, but that was the only good point. The music may be considered good by some but to me the songs grated on my nerves and all the background music was cheap and overused. This might be acceptable for kids, but it certainly is not for me. Oh, and cinderella is saddened by this lack of respect to her name.
