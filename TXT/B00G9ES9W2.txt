Wasn't sure about this game at first, but I really enjoyed playing. The quilt pictures you are uncovering are beautiful. I recommend this app or others by GabySoft,  I haven't found one yet that didn't entertain me while I wasted time. The one thing I'd like to see included, and my reason for only four stars, is to give this app some type of penalty. You can just stumble along pushing buttons and still uncover the picture. I would also like to see an option of timing the puzzles, or something so that there is some way of showing you improvement in the game. But I would like these to be optional so that a kid can stumble along and uncover the pictures without penalty like the game is set up now.
