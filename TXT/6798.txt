I don't want to seem like a fanboy of Dalglish, but I do have to say that I've absolutely loved every book he's put out that I've been able to purchase. The Paladins series was one such case ;) These are books that you would rather not put down. I found myself easily reading for 4 hours straight or more, and feeling like barely an hour had passed. I found it easy to lose myself in the story, which is well written, and filled with conflict :P  As another reviewer stated, you find yourself liking one character, and then disagreeing, then pitting them, then wanting to change their course of action. After it all, you see it pan out to an ending that you may or may not like, but hey, that's what I love about Dalglish, he's not afraid to do what must be done. The books can be gory at times, (which gives it a sense of reality) there isn't any chapter long sex scenes that you'll have to worry about either :P I would recommend these books to any person who enjoys fantasy novels, and doesn't mind a little grit every now and then.
