Case is very cute! No paint chipping, no lost stones (yet)...I've only dropped my phone once with this case but so far, so good. Will definitely buy more from them in the future.One thing that I like about ECO.. It seems they actually take the time to respond to the customers who have had negative reviews. Who does that anymore? Hardly no one. Good for them.. that's refreshing to see!
