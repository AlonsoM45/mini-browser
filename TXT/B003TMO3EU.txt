I personally think these are a wonderful asset to use in removing your shellac polish. I had very little problem using them, and had husband help me with my BaD hand. I highly recommend them, due to the less mess, and ease in getting off the polish. Just take some time, and really learn how to use them proper. All good things are worth the extra little few seconds to get the right effect. I think they are great for removing the shellac polish.
