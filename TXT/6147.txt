Dean Cain is a great pick for Super/ Kent. He fits the character of clean-cut, goody-good, do everything the right way. Terri Hatcher is a knockout, plus her character has a lot of fire and spunk which is sometimes lacking from other Lois Lanes. Of course, Lois manages to get into many situations requiring her rescue.  John Shea is awesome as Lex Luthor. One other part of the series I like is the fact that in this show Clark's  earth father is still alive.
