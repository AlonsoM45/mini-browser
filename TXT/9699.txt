The Chronicles Of Trellah, Is a genuine page turner.  It will keep you guessing til the end.  The adventures of Sophina, a smart witted,seemingly fearless young lady that will stop at nothing to get her brother back.  The many characters in this book keep Sophina on her toes at all times, sometimes getting her into trouble.If you are a fan of Hunger Games or Harry Potter, give Chronicles of Trellah a go...I truly recommend it for kids and adults alike.  My daughter has read it twice and loved it.Can't wait to see what other adventures lie ahead for Sophina.
