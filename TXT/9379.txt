i've never received an email from a seller on amazon market place until today from the folks at crazyondigital. i really appreciate how their enthusiastic follow up not only with their product but, the device i got it for. i got this grey and black case that is super shnazzy and at a good price. i think everyone who has the ipad air should too! thank you guys again!
