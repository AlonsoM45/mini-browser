I had to purchase a remote for 40$ along with this holiday bundle. The xbox description said nothing about it. I thought that was weird. However it was a gift for a nephew out of state, so I had to purchase the remote so he had something to play with the xbox. Basically, I wasted money on buying a remote when the bundle came with one. The xbox worked great though. Nephew was very happy
