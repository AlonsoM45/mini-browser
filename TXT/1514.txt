What a relief, it fits.  After stressing that I had ordered the wrong size, due to other reviews, what a relief to get this adorable hoodie and it fits like a dream.Just ignore your normal size, and order according the size chart from the seller.  That is what I did and it is perfect.  Just in case it helps, I am 5'6, 170 pounds and my bust is a 36B.  1x was perfect.
