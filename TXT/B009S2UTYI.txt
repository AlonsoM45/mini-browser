Miss Arrington's sophomore book shows maturity in writing yet retains the whimsical musing in style and cadence that made her first novel so attractive. Her technical knowledge shows she's done her homework and gives a Tom Clancyness feel to educate the reader and engross them in the details to be part of the action.Her play on words and tongue in cheek references counters the seriousness of the subject matter and action sequences that slingshots the reader through the hurricane ride that is Awesome.The story follows Riley on a case that is to be the perfect storm of events coming together where she is always calm as the eye, on the exterior. She has to tackle personal and professional entanglements of murder, high theft and techie wit all while in heels.Her reputation has chosen her to be co-counsel on what seems to be a standard case for a high profile businessman. Sam Stone wants Riley on his case with him for her brains, body and a chance to break her personal armor. They change their strategy with the case as a hurricane is bearing down on them and they deal with the whirlwinds of events that gives a gratifying end to their cause. Arrington's ease into the subjects and expertise disguises the unexpected turns in the story. She draws on her strength of good character formation with some side characters that deserve books of their own. The storm passes with a satisfactory rush of action to conclude the book while hinting to another storm brewing.I certainly hope to get even more from Riley as Miss Arrington continues her journey. This will be worth waiting for.
