Not much people can really pin point what really happen during reincarnation (by memory at least), however this book showed a unique approach. Whether it's true or not, the plots of the characters here give me some fresh points of view. It triggers some questions within me, what if that's what happens in this real world ? Each different plots were presented in such a natural way, gloomy or happy ending. The gloomy ones left me feeling relieved, that such tragedy in the character was finally ended. The good ones left me with the soothing feeling, that kept me going through all the circle of the chapters.
