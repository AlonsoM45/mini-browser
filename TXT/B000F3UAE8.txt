I have watched this series before and loved it but sadly missed the end so I decided to buy the series to catch up on old memories. It didn't disappoint a bit. It came quite in one pack and was delivered real fast in real good shape. For all that like a kind of mystery show with a entertaining story and a good character play then I would advise you to buy these series. I find it remarkable how Johnny uses his abilitys to help others. Will Johnny though be able to save the future of many people? If you want to know I would buy the series now :D. I know that was mean of me but hes worth it.
