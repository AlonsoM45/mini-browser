One year ago I started looking for a new mattress in the paper, online, and in stores. After 20 plus years on the same mattress and my wife and I with back problems we decided we needed a new mattress. I checked everything on line and saw the reviews on Amerisleep. I was a little apprehensive on getting a mattress online, but with guarantee and a leap of faith, I bought it.The first night on it I knew it was a keeper. I love it, when l lay down I usually wake up in the same position with a nice nights sleep.I certainly would recommend this mattress to anyone.
