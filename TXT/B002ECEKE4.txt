I am never disappointed with Reiker shoes.  They are best for people with severe feet issues. I am using an orthodic with this shoe but it provides some comfort even without my orthodic so that is generally the test for my money.  It is very comfortable and as the company boasts it has the Anti-stress abilities that other so-called comfortable shoes don't possess.I also love the classy styling.  It's hard to find attractive shoes when you have foot and walking problems.Thank you Rieker!
