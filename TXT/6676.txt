the burn pot is beautifully engraved and the wood coaster nice, but the top piece with the screen does not match. The burn pot is more of a engraved silver and black, the lid a plain uncleaned unpolished brass.. does not look like the product photo...  not a big deal I guess..  I give it four stars because of it.
