When I started this series, I wasn't so sure I would finish it.  A little slow at the start but takes off quickly.  Very interesting plot development, characters are complex and lovable.  I found myself searching for more by this author.  Definitely worth the price.  If you enjoy the zombie genre you will thoroughly enjoy each of these books.
