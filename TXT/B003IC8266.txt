This costume is so cute. It actually looks like the picture. If your rough with clothes this might not be for you because it's not delicate, but it's not too tough either so if you pull on it too hard it will rip. The medium fit me perfectly and I'm about 5'2". It also comes with everything it says it does. I absolutely adore it!!!
