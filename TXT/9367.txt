Download wouldn't work; on the otherhand, the agent who arranged forcompensation did a fantastic job. To be ... &#34;fair&#34; ... I've been a Steam/Valvecustomer for years and the download did work. The game just wouldn't play.I could not find direct contact with them except thru forums (useless attempt)to get a refund or credit.I finally purchased the disk from a local store and even then the game wouldnot play until I changed some of the codes imbedded in the game. Now, this ison PC; I spent over $100 for a game that is less fun than Skyrim and that forcedme to modify it in order to play it.
