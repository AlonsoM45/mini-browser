The T-Core is an amazing way to add bulk to your abdominals since it is a resistance weighted piece of equipment.  You will not get amazing abs using this alone, unless you do at least like 3 different exercises till failure using little to no resistance to burn fat.  It is a good thing to add to your already existing ab workout!  However, this requires the activation of your core, which I'm sure most people are not understanding when buying this.  What I mean is; form is key in using this.  Most people will just lean forward and back or use their arms to pull the T-Core down and up.  That is completely wrong and why I believe anyone who has put a bad review down has done.  You need to only move your core and abs, nothing else.  It's much like a cable crunch or normal crunch.  Bend your core and abs, they should be doing all the work.
