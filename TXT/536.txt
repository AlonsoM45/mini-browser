Before watching the life of Brian episode I would of gave Season 12 a 5 star rating, I was intrigued by the New style of there episodes... I'v been a die hard Family Guy fan since Y2K, I bought all the episodes on Xbox live marketplace, and amazon Kindle, the reason I loved the show so much was because of Brian and Stewie together, the time travel episodes were the best... I would consider Seth McFarlen an artist, and I'm not going to jump the gun here, but it would be stupid to keep this Vinny character, it would ruin Family Guy for me and many other loyal fans... I really truly hope to see Stewie fix his time machine and save Brian... I honestly don't think I could keep watching family guy without Brian as a character...
