This is lovely but we have not been able to use it as a lamp because my husband accidently forgot to check the box and threw away the lighting mechanism- OOPS! It is still lovely and we keep it out on the table to look it. If you gets yours and it appears to be wet- don't fret, I talked to the importer and this happens. It is just some of the stain that they use for the base. Simply wipe off the excess and you are good to go.P.S. This guys customer service was AWESOME!!! He is VERY helpful, courtious and replies VERY quickly. Thank you sir!!!
