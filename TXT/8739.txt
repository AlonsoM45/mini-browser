Recently, specifically bought this grinder as it was non-aluminum and certainly not cheap plastic. Never owned a grinder longer than a week, always broke down herbs by hand. A cheap basterd, im very picky when it comes to buying things I really dont 'need' must have great reviews or I wont touch it. I consider myself an average partaker, 6-10 sessions a day, in short order, this grinder is well worth every penny. Grinds herbs to a perfect size, pollen trap works great, easy assembly, good weight. Only flaw of this grinder... the magnet holding the top to the grinder is not very powerful, tip it sideways or upside down & the magnet will fail. Hold upright. Wash metal shavings out.
