I came into the book expecting it to be great, and I was surprised that it exceeded even my own inflated expectations. I've read many of Jules Verne's works, and I can sat that I was thoroughly amused the whole time I was reading this book. I've come to the realization that very few writers today even come close to the marvelous works that were wrought by hands such as Jules Verne. Would I recommend it? YES! If you enjoy a little bit of Sci-Fi, a lot of adventure, some laughs, and some good time well spent you'll love reading Jules Verne's &#34;The Mysterious Island&#34;.
