I hooked it up to my Asus vh236h and it transmitted Audio to my receiver. This is the thing people must know though,IMPORTANT!Toslink/Optical cables DO NOT carry true surround sound audio. They were made to carry Dolby Digital and DTS.Therefore, if your audio transmitting device (Such as: SoundCard, TV or DVD Player) does not support either of these formats, this cable will transmit in PCM 2.0. That means you will only get sound out of 2 of your speakers.
