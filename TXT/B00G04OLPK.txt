I work 12+ hrs a day with 4 computer monitors so these glasses where definitely a must have. They definitely help with the glare and at the end of the day I don't have a headache or feel that my eyes are burning! The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they tend to get really dirty and the cloth they come with doesn't really clean them well.
