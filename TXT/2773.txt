After using over 10 cases for my iPod, iPhone 4, and now the iPhone 5, I can say this is one of the best on the market. It's a huge improvement over the last generation of Candyshells, as it's slightly thinner, and doesn't have the droopy bottom problem on the iPod touch version. It's extremely solid, and the soft rubber part is much less rubbery than previously, and easier to slip in and out of a pocket. The port openings are fairly large, especially compared to other cases. I've heard of problems with the rubber disintegrating, but mine seems good so far - I will update if anything changes. Yes the back is very susceptible to scratching, but any shiny, glossy case will scratch, and that's what the case is there for!
