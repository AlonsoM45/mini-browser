The shipping was great...no problems with that but not only did I receive the wrong color...light brown when I ordered bleach blonde but the quality of the hair wasn't good. Another review compared it to Sally's Beauty hair saying it was better and I completely disagree. Wasn't as long as stated and was thin at the bottom. It definitely won't hold up to heat and styling very long. It's going back.
