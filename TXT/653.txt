Since I bought this for a Halloween costume, I didn't have any great expectations. It looked synthetic and some of the hair had gotten twisted in the bag so that it ended in a flip rather than turned under. The snood was obviously cheap and didn't want to stay on the wig without a couple of large bobby pins (not a problem). I was able to make it look more respectable (for me, an 'older Cleopatra') by shaking it in a bag with baby powder. That dulled the plastic look and gave it a bit of gray. I would never have purchased this were I looking for a human-hair looking wig, but for what I wanted it for, it worked.
