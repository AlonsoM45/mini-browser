This is truly a wonderful game fashioned after the classic Super NES games of the same genre. I commend the programmers for taking the effort to create this mini masterpiece.Someone even took the time to write a mini-walkthrough (highlighting only the basics, but I'm sure there is an update in the works)I only have one question: Got any more?Answer: Of course they do! So far as I have seen, all of Kotobuki Solutions' products are more than worth the pittance they charge.
