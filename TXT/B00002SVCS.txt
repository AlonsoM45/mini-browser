This game gets a 5 out of 5 for several reasons.  One, it looks great.  Whoever designed it obviously thought highly about it and didn't mind poking fun at Pac Man quite a bit, which either works to your advantage or disadvantage depending on scenario.  Pac Man is basically  your pet; you have to instruct him where to go, how to react in situations and help him escape trouble and do Mrs. Pac Man's bidding.  It's a family oriented game, and does not have your typical control scheme.  Pac Man will walk himself and you just point which way to go.  Sometimes Pac man gets scared, happy or sad, and it depends on what you make him do, and how you do it.  I don't know how to classify this game exactly, let's just say it's one of the great ones.  The way I see it it's greatly underrated.  In fact, the only problem I have with this game is how it freezes and resets itself constantly, which I assume is because it's so old.  So, renew this game on some newer models on the Sega Master system, and you're on your way.  Did I mention you can play classic Pac Man on this too? Of course I did.  It gets a 5 out of 5.  If you have a copy, keep it because this game should go into your chronological order of Pac man in Pac Man world. Definitely a fun game.
