I've read this countless times, and within a few pages, I'm once again immersed in th book. From the descriptions of underwater details, fish, treasures, even the sand, it's easy to get lost in it. Like a mini vacation every time. The characters are fully developed, drawing you in further. This is one crew I would love to treasure hunt with, and Marla could cook anytime!  An awesome read from my favorite author!
