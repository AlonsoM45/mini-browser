This boot fits true to its size. It's not too heavy but yet it keeps my feet dry and warm. I haven't used them in snow for hours at a time yet so I may revise this review after that.They are a nice boot to throw on with leggings because they aren't super heavy duty but they have enough fashion flare to wear them casually.The boots were exactly as pictured and shipped 1 day ahead of schedule. I would recommend these boots to others.
