These are must haves to go with your stylus.  After an overly vigorous session with Angry Birds, I damaged a tip and was glad to have a replacement.  The old one still worked for scrolling but was misshapen on one side making finer maneuvers difficult.  If you drop your stylus on concrete (like outdoor use on your patio) the mesh fabric can tear.
