Ive been diagnosed with Tarcel Tunnel (feet) and for the last 3 years Ive been wearing TEVAS! THey are the ONLY ANYTHING that works for me!!! I am usually an 8.5 but the arch fits better for me with a 9 (so I have a bit leftover at the toe~I don't mind at all)!! These were/are a GodSend for me when I found them!!!!Thank you very much TEVA~and keep'em coming!!!:-)
