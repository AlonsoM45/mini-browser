She loves sword art online and I knew she would love this for Christmas.  I placed the order for it at the end of November and I was disappointed that the estimate for delivery after weeks of processing was well into January of next year, but I was SO happy when I saw that it had arrived EARLY!  Much earlier than the estimate.Arrived fast and well packaged, it was definitely worth the wait!  A great Christmas!
