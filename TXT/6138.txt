Not sure if the keyboard works or not, like so many other reviewers, because there was NO directions telling us that we would need an adapter.  The picture is misleading because it shows the adapter with the connection.  In fact, it says to plug the connection right into the tablet.  Now I have to go get one, not a big deal if I had just known specifically that I need to order one at the same time.
