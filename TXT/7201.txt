I live in the UK where these pants are not available so I ordered 5 pairs via a USA friend.They are excellent.Fabric not too thin or light weight and soft.Fit is first class.Style is excellent.Very worthy pants which I purchased in all colours.Only very small niggle is the inner pockets within front pocketsyou have to dig around to retrieve small items.
