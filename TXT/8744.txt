They work great but beware that there are 2 (two) different styles of glass 'daisy' screens. One just looks like a daisy, without a stem if you will. The other has a looks like a daisy with a stem. I currently have both styles on accident. I find the screens without the stem fair better than the others. The stem seems to block the pipe hole, not really useful to me.
