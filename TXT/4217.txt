I am very happy with my purchase. I ordered this case and keyboard to use with my iPad so that I could take notes on my iPad. I am a college student that does a great deal of note taking per day. I was very pleased with my purchase. The case is a great color and the keyboard is awesome. There was a small readjustment period where I had to get accustomed to the keyboard because the keys are a little smaller than average and the shift key is a little farther over than I'm used to, but it really wasn't a big issue. The only thing was that I had to order a stylo from a separate vendor because this one didn't come with one, but it was terribly cheap (like $3.00) so I wasn't too upset about that.The package arrived on time and in perfect condition. All in all, I have no major complaints and would definitely order from this vendor again.
