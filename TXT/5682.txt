I suffered a Severe Traumatic Brain Injury in 1997 and was in a coma for almost two weeks.  They saw the damage in the frontal lobe of my brain, but I think something else was injured (like my pituitary).  I saw a nutritionist and she started me on this.  I prefer natural remedies to drugs even though I have to use both.  This is just one of the three things she had me on from metagenics.  Together they seem to help my mood and my hormones and regulate my cycle more.  Now I am on disability and have a very difficult time affording these products.  They are priced high because they work.  I'm not sure this can help anyone else as my situation is the result of a severe brain injury....Love the product, but keep praying for the price to go lower for me.... Kerry
