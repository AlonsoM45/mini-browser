Very cute charm necklace set, picked it up for me and my sis. I felt a bit worried after reading the reviews that the chain itself was a bit flimsy, but as long as you're not running a marathon or doing construction work in it, it should be fine. Even then, I still recommend getting a new chain for it, just in case. The charms themselves are high-quality and very pretty! My sister loves hers and I've been wearing mine everywhere. Product also arrived much earlier than expected, thanks! If you're a Miku fan who likes things like this, or even just someone looking for a cute set of necklaces, I'd recommend!
