I loved the 20th Century Fox one, this Disney one just isn't as good. They changed the dialog for Mei and Satsuki and some of it just doesn't really fit in well with the movie; also they changed the way Satsuki's name is pronounced. If you listen carefully they changed the way the cat bus meows. If I would have known that this wasn't going to be the same movie as the old VHS one I wouldn't have bought it. It's still good, but not as good as the 20th Century Fox version. Most of the dialog for the father and granny is the same and also most of the background sounds but you can tell they added some more music that to me just doesn't really fit with the original music. But now I know to make sure that when I buy movies I need to make sure they are what I really want. (i just noticed that on the cover on the Disney version they have mixed Satsuki and Mei together! Mei's hair and Satsuki's clothes.)
