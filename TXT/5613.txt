Fantastic series full of wonderful characters, thoughtful situations and both light-hearted and touching moments. The series started strong unlike others that take time to develop.  This is in no small way due to the great acting and scripts.  Highly recommend all the seasons.  The final season that introduced new characters was also fascinating and enjoyable.
