The colors we received are the same as shown above. They seem to be decent quality. My 5 year old is a little tall for her age and weighs about 57 pounds. She usually wears size 7 so I got medium thinking they would be a tad big so she could wear them a little longer. She won't be able to wear these for probably another year because the neckline droops down past her chest. The bottom goes down a little past her belt line, so it's not too long or too short. They fit very loosely around her body. I would definitely buy these again, only a size smaller.
