This was my second reading of the Lord of the Rings(and the Hobbit before it) in the past 10 years or so.  It is one of my favorite books.  I love the story line with its fantasy and relationships among characters. A classic good vs. evil.  With the second reading I picked up on things I missed the first time---or forgot.  I'm sure I'll read it again in future years.
