My 5 stars rating is enough to express my impression of this product. However, it is better if the next edition includes some more up to date entries about the latest events happened to influence the world. I found that the dictionary is somewhat smaller than the Oxford American Dictionary,which I bought earlier, even though both have equal size in product descriptions. The content is so extraordinary, which means exceeded my expectation, the paper and cover are of high quality materials. The only question I keep asking is that the dictionary seemed specially composed for the exclusive use of American people only because the entries and pictures are too Americanized. But most of all I would not change my 5 stars rating for this product since it has brought me a newer nuance in words exploration.
