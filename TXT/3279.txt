I must confess every time Lothaire was mentioned in previous books i would wait desperately to see what becomes of him, for some reason always had a feeling he was much more than his brooding arrogant persona. And boy was I satisfied, could't have asked for a better story. This had much more depth than I had anticipated. KC has done a great job with this badass vampire king who had no feeling of what so ever until he met his bride. I can't wait for the Nix to find her calling. The friendship between Nix and lothaire was always so touching and tender, loved their confrontation. So far my second favorite book after Demon from the dark. Go for this book if you want a resistant bride unwilling to be a bound by the most evil and powerful vampire in the Lore.
