Astonishing, breath-taking, mind-blowing story about the orphan who changed the world. I have to admit that this book was one of the thickest books I've ever read in my life. And in addition to that it was one of the most stunning book's I've ever read in my life.This book is biography of one of the most brilliant minds ever lived on earth. He is Steve Jobs. Everyone knows iPhone, iPad, iPod and many other devices created by Apple Inc. So in this book you can find all the life story of the man who played the main role in creating and developing those amazing technologies and the company itself. And this story isn't simple.I love this book because it's so involving and inspiring. I couldn't put it down since I first took it in my hands. Of course, I haven't read this book in one sip, but until I was finished I could think only about what's next. Another thing that fascinates me a lot, is that in this book there are a lot of dreams, struggles, challenges and victories. Jobs himself was a very difficult, but interesting personality. Some people hate him, some love, some do both, but there is none who don't have any of these feelings for him. His vision was huge, his dreams were unrealistic. Despite all of that, he made everything to make them come true.I greatly encourage you to read this book. If you have big dreams, huge visions, wish to succeed - Steve Jobs biography is a must read for you.
