1. mount on desk or table 2. mount screen 3. adjust to your viewing using pleasureYUP it is that friggin easy!I just wanted a simple quick way to mount my 24 inch monitor in my spare room. I have swapped out 2 monitors on there and it continues to be just as durable. The aluminum is strong and easy to wipe down and keep clean. Love it for my extra bedroom.
