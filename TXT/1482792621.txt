Wow!! I loved this book as much as the others. When I bought Come Away with Me I couldn't put it down and when I finished it I had to buy the others to read.  This series is the best so far.  Will and Meg have such chemistry together. I like how Will is interested in Meg when she shows him she isn't interested in him in the beginning. Then once he goes to the hospital where Meg works to visit the Children's ward, things start to get interesting. Their relationship has there ups and downs but in the end they fall so in love with each other that you can't help but fall with them.  I like how Kristen Proby writes about the other characters, Luke, Nat, Jules, and Nate in each book. I love reading about this family, keep it going Kristen, the Montgomery men are worth reading about!!
