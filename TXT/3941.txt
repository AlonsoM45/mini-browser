i bought this in hopes that it would be comparable to the original beauty blender (which i have purchased before) and i was extremely disappointed. it doesnt get soft when wet and it makes blending in concealer and foundation very hard and doesn't blend out evenly. I'm very irritated that i waited 3 weeks for this to get delivered and end up regretting it so much
