It's a fun game with lots of flash, color and sound. However, I have to repeatedly quit playing after just a few minutes because there is a limited number of lives. I don't wish to have to contact my Facebook friends in order to continue playing. An annoying drawback to an otherwise fun game. I wish I could play it for longer periods of time without having to quit.
