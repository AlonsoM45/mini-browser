I'm a software developer and hoped to get some business insight into the how and why the big 4 have developed a "platform". The term "platform" seems to be used quite loosely and there is little insight, interviews or research to back up claims made throughout the book. After reading the first two chapters I did not learn anything new and the rest of the book makes a lot of generalized claims that, as someone with an IT background, makes me cringe.
