This little book packed a lot of information in 224 pages...beautiful photos, great ideas and good information about the photos so that you can find what's depicted and described.  I liked that it was broken down into sections:  Garden Portraits, Digging In, Garden Structures, Plant Palette and Finishing Touches.  I actually checked it out from the library, and realized that I had to have one for myself so that I can refer back to it...as I'm sure I will again and again.  It truly showcases the very best in Southern garden design.  Highly recommended.
