Just finished reading  Christmas Grace.  Couldn't put it down.  A well written story with well defined characters and story line.  You could tell exactly what each character was feeling but you could not anticipate how the story was going to play out.  You laughed when they laughed, cried when they cried but always kept wondering what was going to happen next.  I would recommend this book to those who love a good romance or good stories about the lives of every day people.
