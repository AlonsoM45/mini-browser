although they dont fall under army regulations i dont advise you wear them in garrison, but down range who cares. hiking up mountains was so much easier because i wasnt busting my butt everywhere. breathable REALLY breathable feet get cold in the winter. weight was  rediculously light i compared them to the nikes and its a really close call. overall for a down range boot A++
