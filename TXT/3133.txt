uNu sent me a FREE case for review and believe me, I could not be any happier! I am glad I had the opportunity to participate in the UTry program.The uNu Dx protective case provides full convenience, allowing for an extra full charge of your iPhone, at the same time providing the durability and quality that protects the iPhone 5. The case itself comes in three different colors: white, black, and red. The finishing on the case is a nice a matte, that allows for a smooth and firm grip. It is form-fitted for the iPhone 5 and has cut-outs of all of the ports for easy access.The case provides a 2300 mAh battery, allowing for an extra 100-110% charge. One of the key features of this case is that while charging your phone, it charges the case at the same time. The case also enables syncing, alleviating the problem of taking off the case every time you need to sync onto itunes.In the box, it comes with the case, screen protector, and adaptable headphone jack. The adaptable headphone jack is required for even the use of apple earphones because of how deep the case protrudes from the headphone jack. After using the case for 3 days, I am VERY impressed on the quality of the product. I fulled used all of the battery on my iPhone, and the case still managed to charge it back to 100%. The case does add bulk, but I think this only makes the phone easier to hold. I would fully recommend this case to anyone wanting a quality battery case, that also protects the phone. The only problem that I came across when using the case was that their was NO protrusion from the iPhone screen and the case, so if you face the screen on a table, it would touch the surface. Overall, the case is built great and is a recommended buy!Pros:charges an extra 100-110%durable/protectivevariety of colorscase charges and sync without removal.Great matte finishCons:No protrusion of case to screenAdaptable headphone jack required
