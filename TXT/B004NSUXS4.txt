We bought one of these about 6 months ago and within  a week my entire family was completely sold on it !!!  They are a wonderful device and every home should have at least one !  I have actually purchased 3 of them and just bought one for my father.  I have yet to change the batteries and have had not a single problem.  I was also very smitten with the ease of installation.  I am not the handiest person in the world but was able to install and program the lock, without help, in less than 10 minutes.  My only advice to any potential user is to replace the door knob with a knob without a lock on it - this keeps anyone from locking the knob before pulling the door shut.  I bought &#34;passage&#34; knobs for each door from Home Depot for $11.00 ea. - boom, no accidental lock out.
