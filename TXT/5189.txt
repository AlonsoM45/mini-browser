I'm a professional wood worker with 22 years under my belt building full custom  furniture.  I have used many other brands and styles of compound miter saws. when i  used this bosh  Saw i was blown away by the eas of cuts and in the ease of the moments when used as slide saw. The movements were flawless and easy to move.. the one draw back was its moves to easily and you must adjust it moments to help a bit ..i used the drag screw to give just a bit of resistance..perfect saw  for me
