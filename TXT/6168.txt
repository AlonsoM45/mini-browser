Very lightweight, perfect size for 4 or 5 year oldIt floats, that is great for any age.Cast action is simple and very easy to useThe spool is a good size to limit overrides, does not jam in the spool, like most reelsPractice plug is a great feature.Has a penguin or two, but not obnoxious, like most of the children's rods that are covered with characters. Once this is out of the packaging, looks like a nice blue and white fishing rod.
