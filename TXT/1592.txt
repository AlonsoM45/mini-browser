JUST RECEIVED THE 3 SATCO BULBS. NONE OF THE SPECS SHOWED THE DIAMETER OF THE GLOBE TOP. THESE ARE 5".  THE BULBS I HAVE PURCHASED IN THE PAST ARE 4.5" THE 5" ARE TOO BIG TO FIT IN THE TOOL I HAVE BEEN USEING TO INSERT THIS TYPE OF BULB.MY CEILINGS ARE 12ft HIGH, AND I AM TO OLD TO USE A 10 FOOT LADDER.
