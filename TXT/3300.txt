Me and my 2 year old LOVE this book and mitts, I bought 2 one for us and I gave one to a friend for her baby shower! because every parent needs this (: this book creates the most beautiful sound throughout our home... laughter! uncontrollable deep belly laughter that takes his breath away! we read this book everyday sometimes more then once! he will bring it to me and ask me to be the tickle monster! and no matter what I am doing I stop and put on the gloves! (: probably our favorite book!
