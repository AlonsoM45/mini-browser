I lost my dog not long ago. I was really heartbroke. I ordered some books on dogs going to heaven but they didn't seem to help. I then bought "Biblical Proof Animals do go to Heaven". I cried, I laughed, and it educated me. But mostly I know for sure now where my beloved dog is. This book is amazing. It has bible proof and a beautiful story that once you start to read it, you can't put it down! I give it 5 stars!! If you read this book you will have no doubts that your pet is in heaven.
