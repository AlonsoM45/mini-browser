I rated this 5 stars due to the fact that I had had a larger size Kong before and it was able to stand up to my Huskys' play.  This was a dog that could destroy anything within 5 minutes.  Except his Kong toy.  I got the puppy Kong for my american eskimo/husky puppy and she loves it!  Keeps her occupied for hours.  The only problem I have now is keeping the cat from stealing it and hiding it.  She loves it too!  My only complaint, if you could call it that, is that they don't give you a choice of colors.  My dog is a female, and although I'm not sure how well dogs can tell colors, I would prefer that I was given a pink one instead of blue.  Minor complaint, I know.  Otherwise this far exceeds any other toy she has.
