I have enjoyed quite a broad range of vampire movies.  Some good, most bad.  This movie was not bad.  It was far from good though.  Some of the scenes were good and pulled you in.  However, Bill Paxton's character was putrid at best.  If your bored and alone, watch it.  If your with others, I would skip over this title.
