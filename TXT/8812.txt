Don't get me wrong, I really love Black Veil Brides. The music was fantastic on this album. The extra songs were worth it. But as far as the Legion of Black video goes, I was very disappointed.It's just one long music video.No dialogue at all besides the dialogue that comes in the songs already.The story was hard to follow. It's not even a story really.If you want the extra songs, just buy them online. It's not worth your money to buy the video.
