Guardian in training Rose Hathaway had been on the run with her best friend, and moroi princess, Lissa Dragomir for 2 years when they are finally caught and returned to their school St. Vladimir's Academy.Upon arrival they are escorted to headmistress Kirova's office where is decided they will both continue their enrollment at said school.Rose must balance her life when others try and knock her down while struggling to learn to control her bond with Lissa.I LOVED the Vampire Academy series. All 6 books. They are by far my favorite books in all time followed closely by The Bloodlines series. I am not an english teacher and am quite rubbish at writing to be honest so I wouldn't be able to critique her writing style but I absolutely love these books.
