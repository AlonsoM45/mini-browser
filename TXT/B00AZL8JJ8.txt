When I started reading this book, I was thinking to myself that I could finally relate to a character in these types of books because Sinai is in school like me. So I appreciated that. A lot of these books have characters that are doing all types of things, but forreal, it's hard to find regular people just doing regular things.I liked how all of the people in the story had a place and everyone came together. It just reminded me of real life. Sinai is a girl that you don't like, but you do like her. You know she's wrong for what she's doing, but you can't help but wish you could get away with having any dude you wanted like that.But onto makenzey jade as a writer. This girl is not an amateur. I read the bio in the book and it says she's young which is inspiring. For her to write that great and professional for her age is cool to me because I feel like I can do something like that too. No typos, developed characters, more than I can say about some of the more popular writers I've seen on amazon.Looking forward to what comes next. Will there be a sequel? Because, I wanna know what happens to Armand
