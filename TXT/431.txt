I have been reading this author for many years and I believe I liked this book the best of all.  The author has a unique way of giving you the ability to see and feel what is going on.  Edward Beale was a very interesting man and the author brings his story to life.  If you love history and the old west, you will love the facts and descriptions of how it really was when Mr. Beale came out west.  I would whole heartedly recommend this book to anyone who loves feeling like you are actually there with Mr. Beale.
