I highly recommend purchasing a pair of Audio Technica ATH-ANC7B Noise Cancelling Headphones!!!!!!!Before purchasing these Audio Technica ATH-ANC7B Noise Cancelling Headphones I compared numerous brands & models. Cheaper ones were less quality, poor audio/noise cancelling and uncomfortable. Higher quality ones were over priced and compared to the ATH-ANC7B's the additional cost was unjustifiable.I just used these on flights from Newark to Roatan and loved everything about them. Top features include sound quality, comfort, noise cancelling w/ or without audio, battery life, and compact size/carrying case.Excellent value and Amazon had the lowest price to be found!
