Not only did this come in the original package, but  this game works perfectly.  You gotta love the arcade version, but in my opinion this is better.  It gives you a super rush every time you're trying to type sentences and difficult words in seconds before you're clawed  and killed by zombies.  The characters are memorable, and it's fun looking at the agents with their keyboards.  If you need to get your adrenaline running, typing of the dead is for you, not to mention it'll upgrade your typing accuracy for life.  Talk about a creative idea!
