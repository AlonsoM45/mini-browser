Not a whole lot to say about these patches. I got 5 different ones from Gladsen and Culpeper, and got free shipping.  I think the patches are decently made, with good stitching. The quality on the patches is good, and heavy duty enough.  Not incredibly awesome...but good, and for the price 3 bucks...5 stars because I got 5 patches shipped for FREE.
