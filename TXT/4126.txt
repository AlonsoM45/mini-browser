As someone with very little sales experience, I predict this book saved my YEARS of trial and error mistakes. While it is peppered with up-sells by the author, the enticing nature of these simply show you he knows how to sell. 80/20 as a concept changed my whole life, and this book's application of it changed my business and mindset.
