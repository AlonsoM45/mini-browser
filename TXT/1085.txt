I have tried just about every name brand sunglass out and none compare to the fit of Bolle's. I have a pair of Costas which cost me 200 plus and I am scared to wear them because they scratch so easily.As many stated, yes they are a very large pair of shades, but if you have a bog noggin and like the coverage they provide against the sun on the Water then these are for you. I work in the Gulf and nothing compares. I have owned Bolle's in the past and been sold on the quality and lasting durability for years.Here's the but, the float head piece does not fit over the ear section of the sunglasses, so it's useless and I really wanted to use it. I drive boats and I have had sunglasses fly off before to be lost for ever.Bolle, you need to send the correct head float with these sunglasses.
