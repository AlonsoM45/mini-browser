This book is a great idea. I love the thought and work put into it but it feels more like a rough draft than an actual book to me. It was hard to keep up with when the characters came in. They were strangers an  then it skipped a ton and they were all friends. I wish he would of explained things a lot more instead of skipped around. I also wish I knew more about what happened when the aliens came and the experience they went through at that time. A great second book would be from the people's point of view that left earth with the aliens. This book has.  Lot of potential. It was worth the read.
