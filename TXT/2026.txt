I had to completely take the trap apart myself and put the trigger rod in the correct position. The trap was impossible to set the way it came from the factory. Quality control personnel in china should be fired! It's a good thing I have my own tools and know how to use them, or else I'd be stuck with a useless piece of junk!I thought I was buying a quality American made product but was disappointed to find this Chinese made,useless until I fixed it,piece of junk!
