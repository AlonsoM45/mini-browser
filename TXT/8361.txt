This movie is a masterpiece the visuals which were a big part movie were done beautifully the tiger BTW is all CGI something I was astounded with the acting was done perfectly and the storyline is fantastic sometimes it feels a bit slow but its pprobably because I've seen it a few times all in all this movie gets a 4 out of 5 and I would highly recommend buying on Blu ray if you have a Blu rau player to appreciate the visuals this movie offers.
