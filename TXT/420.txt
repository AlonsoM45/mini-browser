This wallet iPhone case fits everything you need to carry when running to the store or out sightseeing, actually pretty much anywhere that you need to go. Great in places where your everyday pocketbook would be too much, like at a football game or to the movies, etc.  The color on this page makes it look like a dark purple.  When you receive yours it is more like lavender.  A coworker ordered the darker red one and it was more muted than the picture shows.  The only thing I have found that I am not completely pleased with is once you put all of your items and phone in it and place it in your pocket (if you don't want to use the wrist strap that is attached) it is a little bulky in you pocket.  Other than that, it is very convenient and come in many colors and is less expensive on Amazon than the ones I have seen around town.
