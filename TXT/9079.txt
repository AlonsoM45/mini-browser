Firstly, the power supply transformer was a dud.  Checked with multimeter, no output.  Obtained a replacement power supply, and the router responded as expected when power was supplied, but my computer (Toshiba Satellite running Windows 7 Professional) did not recognize it.  Followed Cradlepoint instructions to configure, router ceased responding and locked up on first window.  No response at all after that.Fortunately, Amazon's return service worked exactly as advertised.  Unit was returned without a hitch.
