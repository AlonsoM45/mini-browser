I finished 2 things this week:1.)  My sister's new book,  THE ART OF FLOATING.2.)  My brother-in-law's homemade Irish chutney that I brought back to NC following my travels to Maine and Massachusetts.I cozied up this past week in my favorite reading nook in my comfy overstuffed chair complete with an ottoman and a blanket....my nose buried in THE ART OF FLOATING.  Several nights I stayed up past my regimented bedtime simply because I could not put the book down.In my most unbiased opinion (well....maybe I'm a little biased.  I mean she is my sister and all.  Not to mention brilliant, artistic and worldly!) my sister produced a treasured story.  While the power of losing something is often indescribable, my sister puts into words what so many of us are unable to describe.  So vivid, so true and most importantly, so relatable.Just like my brother-in-law's famous chutney straight from his mom's SECRET Irish recipe book, THE ART OF FLOATING is full of mystery and intrigue...with a little bit of spice that make it all its own!  The book combines the power of loss and the glory of discovery AND the process of healing in the face of tragedy.This story is told with a sweetness so tender it will open your heart.  You did it, sis!  THE ART OF FLOATING is truly a work of art that the world should hear.  And as my dad (who typically sticks to books and articles related to history and politics) stated &#34;This isn't just a woman's book.  Everyone should read this!&#34;I love you, Kristin Bair O'Keeffe!!  Congratulations!!
