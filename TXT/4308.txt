This game was so explosive when it first hit shelves, the rumor was that the creators spent over $8000 just to make it or something like that. It's a story of a young man who is on a journey to avenge the death of his father, and well, it goes from there.  The graphics are highly stylized in and located in Japan, where you talk to people, ride motorcycles, play arcade games, train, hunt people down, make phone calls and more throughout different towns and villages.  This is just the icing on the cake, but let's say the amazing thing about this game is that it emulates real life so perfectly and on such a deserving system,  It has I believe, 4 disks to it, and I wouldn't dare leave this life without one.  Very good game.  A must have.
