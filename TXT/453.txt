I have had this product for about a month now, and they have never once lifted off of the keys or caused any issues with having to reapply them. They are simply 3M stickers that sit right on top of your keys and they look and feel great! They were much easier to apply than I would have ever thought! When I am ready for a different design, I will DEFINITELY buy from this company again!
