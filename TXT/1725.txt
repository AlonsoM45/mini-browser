Picture on cover is what you are being taught in this book. If you are looking to learn how to crochet, this is not the book for you. Actually, I learned by watching videos on YouTube. Then I looked at books, magazines and tv shows. This book has information. It has one pattern followed by more info. It's not a bad book but title is misleading. I suggest you get this book while it's free, but use it as a guide and one of your tools to help you learn to crochet. But be aware that it won't teach you in your first steps of crochet.
