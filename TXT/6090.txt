From the first time I opened them, I am extremely blown away by these headphones. My only warning is that your ears are VERY prone to get hot while exercising wearing these and it's easy for people around you to hear. The bass is powerful and the on-ear style is very comfy. This is the perfect companion to listen to anything anywhere, just not while active.
