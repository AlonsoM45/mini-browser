Brought it for a 7 year old girl! She really likes its! Its bigger then expected and has alot of pages! 890 i think... It also has activities and little questionaires I thinks its more suitable for girls ages 7-13. Younger girls might have a hard time with the questions and games depending on there ability to read. Its also heavy for smaller girls. It is really cute and a great buy for some one with a low budget!
