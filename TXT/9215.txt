I gave it to a co-worker who teaches sixth-graders for a Christmas gift.  She loves it, not only for how pretty it is, but also for the message it carries to remind her how to encourage her students to achieve their best every time she wears it.  It seems well made, and is a very attractive piece of jewelry.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.
