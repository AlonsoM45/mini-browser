I liked the case when I first received it.  It looks different from the usual cases and has a touch of bling.  However, the case does not stay in tact for long.  The edges started to fray, and the front orange flap is separating from the black backing.  This separation started happening after the first week or two of using it.  I predominately keep my phone in my purse or on a table (wherever I am).  So, it is not getting bounced around a lot.  I suppose I could glue it back down, and see how long that holds up.  I started cutting the extra white strands that periodically stick out around the edges.  But, I have to keep doing this because more strands come out.  I will shop for a more durable case next time.
