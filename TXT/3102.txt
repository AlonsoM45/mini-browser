I bought the micro loop extensions and trust me when I say this is the ONLY brush you can use on them! If you try to use a regular brush, the first time you try it, it will snag and either rip it out or feel like its pulling it out!! This brush lets you brush right through the extensions without cause damage and it does not hurt. Buying this brush will be the best thing you spend money on when buy extensions. This is a must have!!
