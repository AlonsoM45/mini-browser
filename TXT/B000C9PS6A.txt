The product was pretty.  The fabric was very nice and looked great.  Ther control was cheeply done.  simple on/off button (which was fine), however doesnt work very well.  At times, would have to turn on/off numerous times before would start working.  Have had it since Oct 24, it still works, and we still use it.  Control just aggrivating at times.
