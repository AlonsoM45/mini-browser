I received the phone case on time as expected. Although I was somewhat upset that 5 of the crystals had already fallen out. I suspect this is either from poor handling while shipping, or poor gluing from the company. The color of the case is wonderful and all my friends ask where I bought it. I love the leopard design and fur texture, but really wish the crystals weren't falling out so quickly. Recommended for young to teenage girls for any event!
