Sequels are always hard to write. People usually have high expectations if the first book was really awesome (which is was in this case) and it's difficult to live up to those expectations of all of your fans. But Julie Kagawa did exactly that, because this book is AWESOME!Yeah I use that word a lot, but it's true! Allison still is badass, but she annoyed me a bit in the beginning. I get it, she misses Zeke and to be honest, I would too, but come on... Just kick some ass and maybe you'll get to see him again! She struggles to keep her humanity and control her vampire side and doesn't always succeed in that. So I still love her!It was cool to get to know the other characters better too and see some old ones from the first book return! I did miss some of themJulie's writing still is beyond brilliant. I love how she describes the world she has created and in this novel we get more details of that world, which is great because it helps me to get more into the story! She keeps me on the edge of my very comfy couch and really hooks me to the story in a way not many authors can. And she can make me swoon with some scenes. I seriously was reading with a big smile on my face at times. She can take my breath away and crush my heart at the same time. (Thanks for that...)Of course she left me hanging at the end, which I kind of expected from her, but it sucks nonetheless...I give this book 4 stars because the slow beginning and Allison's references to Zeke in the first few chapters were a bit annoying but it's a great book and those who love the first one, will love this one just as much!
