I just got this today. The massage is somewhat good, but not great. It is more like a low rumble than anything, but I didn't get it for that only. That was just a bonus. As a lumbar cushion on its own, it does a good job. I can already feel the effects of it after sitting at my office chair for a few hours. My spine feels aligned. I also like that it has a strap that you can tighten to tie down the cushion in place.My only concern is the durability of the battery compartment. The outer construction is fine and the foam is fine too.The color is also black, not a light grey as shown in the pictures.Also another poster mentioned something about the massage not functioning even with batteries in. The reason could have to do with the batteries not touching the positive terminals. I had the same issue, but after nudging the four batteries towards the positive terminal, it started working.
