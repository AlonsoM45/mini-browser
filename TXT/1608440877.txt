This book has it all - drama, comedy and an emotional roller coaster ride. Now take into consideration that all of that alone falls into one character throughout the book, and you can only imagine what transpires with everyone else involved in the story. Living The Dream follows Kurt on an escapade that he devises as the perfect plan, which backfires on him from the start. It's a non-stop, action-packed adventure that will having you wanting to turn the pages faster than you can read them. From the very first page you will understand why you love and hate Kurt at the same time, rooting for him on one page and wanting him to get his just desserts on the next, and why no matter what you think of him you will always want more of this loveable loser. If you are looking for a great action novel that will keep you guessing until the very end (I know I did), then Living The Dream is the one book that you must have in your collection..................and oh yea Tim's other books only get better (as hard as it was to top this one),
