Stretch the material. These boots are high quality and did not rip even a single thread as I pulled and stretched them for my wife. I'm 6`1 270 and can pull relatively hard. I honestly would have expected any pair of boots to be destroyed by the stretching but they held up. I really wanted to see these on my wife, and it was worth the effort. Stretch `em before you return `em.
