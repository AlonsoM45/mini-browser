The Foscam FI8919W is a great camera. I am a dealer for Foscam and I sell a lot of the FI9810W. Fantastic camera for the money. I thought I would try this camera and bought 3 for my company to test. So great... We hooked it up in 5 minutes, setup is like any other Foscam Camera, the IR works great, not sure why people are putting this camera down... We have been "working" one of the cameras all the time to try to make it fail and it still works great. Im buying more and going to promote it more as well.
