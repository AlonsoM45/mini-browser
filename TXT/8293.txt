I liked the information given on why we should or should not consume certain fats, etc.  Dr. Wythe not only gave reasons about topics he also went into detail.  That was my most favorite part of his book.  It would have been nice if the charts were in the book rather than have to go online to retrieve them--that is the only thing I did not like about his book--not having the charts to refer to as I read the book.  I am trying some of the recommendations and menus given--bot not all.  Furthermore, I would recommend this book to anyone intereseted in knowing what they should and should not do to lose weight.
