This is a great flavor of coffee. It is plenty strong without the burnt taste you get from the french roast. I am very glad I was able to find a good tasting inexpensive coffee for my coffee maker. The only draw back I have found is you have to keep the coffee in a ziploc bag or a similar airtight container after opening each bag (there are 8 pods to a bag). All in all I highly recommend this coffee as a good inexpensive choice for a Keurig style coffee maker.
