I received this from Influenster to try for free. I liked it but I did not love it. I does make your teeth somewhat whiter but it leaves a weird taste and feeling in my mouth. It is also a bit pricy. I would recommend it to friends, but I don't think I will buy any for myself, but I am very picky when it comes to toothpaste. So it could just be me.
