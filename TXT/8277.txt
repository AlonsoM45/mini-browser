These are issue, circa 91. You can not beat it for the price, especially thinking about what our careless government spent on these. If you use a built in magazine pull like the ones on Troy battlemags or the slip on variety such as Magpul magazine pulls, the flaps on this will not even come close to snapping. If your using duct tape and 550 cord, maybe, thats a BIG maybe they will snap close. Its a tight fit. If your using plain pmags, troy battlemags, promag, gi steel mags, or colt mags (all 30 rounders) then they should snap for you.Its not a bad idea to buy 2 of these and keep one loaded and another one full of empty mags that you rotate every 6mo, that way if the S ever does HTF then you should have 7 mags ready to go (one in your rifle), standard combat load for US troops is 210 rounds, 7 mags.
