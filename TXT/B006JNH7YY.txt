I really like this type of game. The storyline was predictable though. Gave five stars  mainly because it is a good time waster. It is not one of my favorites and may not play again. Had plenty of hunt and find but I felt some were pointless. They didn't need all they put in and the story would've flowed better without some of them but I think they wanted to make sure purchaser had more game time. Which I am all for. But maybe they  could've put in more mini puzzles n place of the pointless hunt and finds. This sounds bad and you may be wondering why I gave it five stars, the game played well with no glitches and it can't be easy to try to make a game to please everyone. G5 has never failed in making games I enjoy. They deserve the stars because I just may be too critical you should definitely try the game yourself. You will get your money worth of time spent playing.
