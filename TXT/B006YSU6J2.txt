I found this in the children's section of kindle books. This is not a children's book! This book is a soapbox for the author. And the poems are not "inspirational" at all. The author trying to label this a children's book is the most horrifying part of all. I understand her desire to teach children to find other supplements to replace what is found in meat, but there is nothing on God's green earth that would compel me to read this book to a child. I do have a question though, near the end of the book, she writes about a mouse that got inside her house. She does not say how she got it out of her house, why not?
