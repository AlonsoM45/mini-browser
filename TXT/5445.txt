MMMMMM. Yummy smelling. I use it in a reed/stick diffuser and put a few drops in the water pot on my Wood pellet stove. Keeps the air moisturized and smelling nice, with the water/oil combo. Great for every home. Reliable seller. Trustworthy. I am going to make up the bug repellent brew i just read on here. Especially as a deterrent against spiders. This OlD home we live in needs such a product. Eco-friendly, here we come!
