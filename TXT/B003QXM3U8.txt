I bought this product in June 2014. The filter just lasted for 1 week and then the water started tasting like lime. I complained to the manufacturer but the delivery of the filter was delayed by almost 20 days. We got a replacement filter but within 3 days the water is again tasting sour. I am going to return this product and look for some better product.
