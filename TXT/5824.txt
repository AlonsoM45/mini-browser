Pros:Its comfortablelooks goodThe sound quality is good when its working.Cons:The audio jack had to be twisted to make a good connection in several of my devices. It is apparent that it doesn't work well.The microphone jack simply doesn't work. it worked for about three minutes then became unusable. My friends and my tests have shown that when plugged in they cannot hear me, instead they hear a banshee giving birth to conjoined twins.I have serious doubts that there is an actual microphone in the headset, because the sound control also has what appears to be an inline microphone. That sounds like false advertising to me, but I'd have to take it apart to find out.I will update this after I take it apart, because if it is only cosmetic I don't need it there.In the end I think this headset was a bad attempt at a good design.
