I love this case!  It fit perfectly.  It fits very snug and securely, and is made of a very firm foam.  The foam is so firm that if you squeeze it between your fingers as hard as you can, you can feel it &#34;give&#34; only slightly.  The swival handle/kickstand  is stiff enough to stay where ever you set it.  The Lindle sets in the case in such a way that, even if you dropped it on it's face, it probably wouldn't damage the screen.  (honestly haven't tried that)  I think this is an excellent case at a fair price!
