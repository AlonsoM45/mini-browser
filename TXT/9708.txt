These running shoes arrived earlier than expected and were ready to go! No break in period!! I have worn EVERY brand of running shoe and I am very impressed by the quality, comfort, support and feel of these runners. They are at the top of the list and my feet need specifics. They do not bother my achilles or my plantar faschiitis which I am both prone too and they also helped with my hip stability due to the smoothness of the stride of the shoe. I will be ordering another of the same next time the price is right as well!! :)
