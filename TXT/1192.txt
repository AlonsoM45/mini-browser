The poker games are fun but very addictive game  that is very tough to beat the computer on any hand you win and try to double your small prize  ..... it will beat you 19 times out of 20 and you will lose all you just worked so hard to gain.  Very low on my list to keep you wanting to return for more ....... come on guys , these are only points ..... not money.
