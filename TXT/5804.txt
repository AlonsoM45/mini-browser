I would definitely order from this company again. The product arrived before expected which was great, and it was well made. It also gives full protection of the Ipod and is really soft which is awesome. Personally I love it! The only warning I could give is that one the bow wasn't blue it was like a purple (but it was still cute) and two it was a little bit big for the Ipod especially around the button on the top of the ipod. I wish there were more cases like this one for the Ipod.
