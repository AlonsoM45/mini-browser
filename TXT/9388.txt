Bought for my 18 mo old. He is a little young for it, but my friend's almost 3yo went right for it and played with it for a long time...and that was the last time the drill worked properly. It only lasted for ONE playtime! I have an older Fischer Price drill that I got second hand and it is still working. The insides of the ALEX drill must be the cheapest plastic they could find. This could be a really great toy if they would provide a drill that would stand up to the age group that it was built for. Hey ALEX.... can you send me a new- better drill??
