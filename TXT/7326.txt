I used this flashlight 5 times before the internal switch failed. I didn't even get past using the original batteries that came with the flashlight. My single battery Fenix tactical flashlight purchased ion 5/01/2009 is of better quality and has lasted to the present day. I sure hope that our Special Operations Group warriors are not using this light in combat operations, It is s piece of crap.
