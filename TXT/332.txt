I really loved this short story about what Devereux did the night before he met Kismet. Just as the author suggests, you really should read "The Vampire Shrienk" before you read this one, even though this was set in time before he met her. It was such a joy to read and I really like that it is a short story. It gives you a little more knowledge of what Devereux was like before he met Kismet and what he was dealing with. I would definatley recommend it to anyone!! If you like "The Vampire Shrienk" you will absolutely love this one!
