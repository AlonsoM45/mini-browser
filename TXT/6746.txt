The Snugg does fit the iPad3 perfectly as advertised.  I love the hand strap and have used it several times for work (this was one of the features that led me to buy it).  Although I haven't used it yet, I also like that it has a stylus holder on it as well.  The case seems very durable and I would recommend it to others.
