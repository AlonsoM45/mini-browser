This mouse was a major improvement from my old dell wired mouse that I've had for years. It is very lightweight and have 3 sensitivity settings that were very useful. The mouse itself isn't very comfortable in your hand, but like with everything else, you get used to it. I've had this mouse about 8 months when it started to act up. The left and right buttons would start to double click or sometimes wouldn't click at all. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the actual buttons, it might just be that the sensor inside the mouse is going bad. It gets very annoying when playing games and greatly affects gameplay. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because you will not find a better mouse for the same price anywhere.P.S. The LED in the mouse stays on even when I turn off my computer which is very annoying and the mouse must be unplugged every night.
