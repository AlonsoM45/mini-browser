I bought this screen as a replacement for my cracked screen ( I slammed the machine shut) I was somewhat hesitant because of the price, however since receiving and installing the screen Ive been very impressed by the quality and colour of the screen. I would recommend this screen to anyone needing to replace a crack macbook screen and who isnt afraid to DIY.
