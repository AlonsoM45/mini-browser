First thing you should know is that I'm one of the biggest skeptics out there. &#34;HANDS DOWN&#34;.. lol.. However, this product is absolutely positively amazing. A friend suggested it to me because of my chronic back pain, and the numbing and tingleness from a near fatal car accident i had back in 2010.  one month later, I decided to try it.. First thing I noticed is that my skin started clearing up from severe acne,(stress related) my face became brighter more even tone, and the glow is irresistable. Everyone started asking me did I start working out, I said no, with a puzzled look on my face.. Then I realized, it's the AminoSculpt that gave me the muscles without the gym... BONUS!!!!  In closing, it also aides me with falling asleep at bed time instead of all the meds they have me on for pain and sleep.. The only bad thing is, I'm not able to purchase it as often as I should. I'm off then on.. . But overall, it's a great product and I recommend it to my friends and family especially the ones with health issues.. I hope this helps someone out there.God Bless
