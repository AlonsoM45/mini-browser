The crate itself is made well, they just designed it poorly.  The clips that hold everything together in alignment are all placed incorrectly.  They could go an inch either way and hit nothing, but they seem to have been placed right in line with cross members of the wire frame on the front panel and properly placed on the rear panel.  So, they hit the wires and distort the front door so badly that it's a pain to open and close.  I would not buy one again without trying it out in person to ensure everything aligns properly.  Who knows what it is that creates the inconsistency (new welder, bad machine alignment, poor quality reviewer), or whether it's just a problem with my unit, but it's maddening.
