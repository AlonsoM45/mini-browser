I used this in conjunction with the Green Coffee Bean Exract and I lost 10lbs. in 2 weeks. The price is great here. I bought the green coffee bean and rasberry ketone from a health store and it cost me $70.00 for both. Here I bought both and added the african mango extract for $45.87. Can't beat that. This is an all natrual product made by Essential Source, you can check their website and read about all the products they offer. I'm still waiting on my order hopefully will come in soon. I've been out for about a week and I can tell a difference in how I feel. I'm back to feeling blah. I hate that feeling. Hope this helps anyone wanting to try. Oh and it doesn't taste to bad, reminds me of a cough syrup. But you only take it 2x a day under the tongue for about 30 seconds then swallow.
