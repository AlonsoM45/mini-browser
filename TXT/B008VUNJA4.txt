I hate this monitor, wish I would have never wasted $200 on it. My first problem with it is that it times out every 15 minutes. why in the world would you have a baby monitor time out, the point of the monitor is to watch your baby ALL night, how on earth do you expect me to watch over my baby if im constantly having to log in, so I had to buy a second monitor TOTAL WASTE. my second problem is if you try to log back in too fast it doesnt work you have to go completely out of the ap and start over. I wouldnt recommend this monitor to anyone and have already warned multiple people not to waste their money.
