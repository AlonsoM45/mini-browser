I HIGHLY Recommend this wonderfully written book. Be it through a book or electronic. So well written and truly helps you see things in a different manner. I recently lost my hero, my father, and this has helped to heal some of my pain. I love James Van Praagh and Doreen Virtue shines bright also. Do Not be fooled by this size. It packs a punch and a bunch of helpfulness on each and every page. Many hugs to all. Much Love and Light.
