was a little slower to ship than the rest of my order but for the price it was worth the wait. its hard to find a decent cell case for a guy that isnt just black for the droid 4. stands out and people seem to like it. i kind of expected it to be a little more rubbery since its &#34;rubberized&#34; but id definitely buy from this company again.
