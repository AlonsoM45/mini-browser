From the photo, I thought this watch was made of links and had a clasp. The watch actually is just a band and has a buckle. I think it makes it look a little bit cheaper than what I'd hoped for, but it's still nice. It's just a simple, everyday watch to wear. I got it for my boyfriend for his birthday, I think he will like it. He's the kind who would beat up his watch quickly by working, so I was afraid it wouldn't be durable enough, but I think it is. Definitely not a watch that you would want to wear with a suit.
