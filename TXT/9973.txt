Love this scale. The only problem I have is I wish the top were just a little larger. When you weigh a large item, it's hard to see the weight and hard to find the button to hold the weight while you take the package off. But if it was bigger, it wouldn't be so portable!! So, it works well and I'm happy. Needs 4 1/2 stars
