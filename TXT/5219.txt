I bought this for my daughter's bed. We are currently potty training her.At first it smells like plastic but I air it out for a few days and the smell is gone.The top part is terry cloth and the other side is plastic material.It doesn't make any crinkle sound when she sleeps on it, so it doesn't bother her sleep.She wet her bed once and i didn't change the bed right away because i have to clean her up.The urine didn't leak. It is waterproof.All in all, we love this mattress protector.
