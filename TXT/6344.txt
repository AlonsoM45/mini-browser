My grandmother gave me this book while I was on bed rest when I was pregnant with my son. and I have to say John saul book "The Right hand of evil" kept me enterained. It was my first book of his that i've read and I absolutely loved reading it. I am now reading "When the wind blows" and love that book as well. If you are considering reading this book I promise you wont be dissapointed.
