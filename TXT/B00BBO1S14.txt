I got this knife for my girlfriend on Sept 20th 2013.. Today is March 5th 2014 and its still holding up.. she has it on her key chain and uses it everyday. Its blade is still as sharp as the day we got it.. the only complaint I have is that I bought a gold one and now months later, the gold rubbed off so it is silver now... But 5 stars!!! It's great
