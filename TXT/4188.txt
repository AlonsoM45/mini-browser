Well written and creative! Loved the story for the most part.The characters are strong, especially Beatrice. Her thoughts and feelings are strong and the interaction she has with the others works well throughout. The story really drew me in. Seeing the different factions and how different they were and how they interacted was really interesting. How Beatrice overcame obstacles and progressed through the story made me want to keep reading more and more.The story is fast paced, the action intense and keeps you involved.Parts where I think the story could've been better were the character development. I think it was good, but it could've been a lot better in my opinion. I didn't connect with the main character as much as I would've liked to. Not that it was bad, because the character was really good, I just think it could've been better.The ending was okay. The emotions seemed off at the end. I felt it was a bit rushed. That was really the only time in the book when I wasn't connecting with the characters. The ending was left hanging for the next book.  If you're looking for a book that sums up completely, this isn't it. There will probably be a few more on the way. But it's definitely worth it.(Possible Spoilers)I think some parts came too easy to her, like the Capture the Flag game. I felt like it could've been more of a struggle and it would've felt like the victory was more of an achievement. The interactions between her and Four was good, but sometimes I felt like it was lacking. Also I felt like security in the area should've been better. It was far too easy for some of the more evil characters to commit violent acts against each other and get away with it.Overall I loved the book and would recommend it. Not book of the year but very good.
