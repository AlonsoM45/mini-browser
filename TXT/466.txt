It doesnt really secure the go pro that well even after you hear a click. i was diving with this and my hand must have hit something and the go pro slipped out. So i see a sting ray and want to take a picture, the go pro was gone! luckily i traced back and found it but you might not get this lucky if you were say snorkeling. Later on i  attach another lanyard to the go pro screw and attach the lanyard to my hand. Tested this again and if something hits the go pro it slips out. Whats the point? It isnt as tough as the go pro is.
