I received this in the mail on time as stated in absolute excellent condition. It fits my boyfriends 3GS perfectly with no odd pieces sticking out or sharp edges. The camo is exactly like the picture states and the two pieces fit together the way they should! I recommend this to anyone who has a brother, dad, boyfriend, or husband that likes camouflage!! (:
