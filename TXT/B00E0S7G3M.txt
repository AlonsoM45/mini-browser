My order arrived within the same week which was a big plus. I was alittle hasty keeping my fingers cross hoping I didnt get jipped.  The life of the ink seems to be lasting its expected time. Being that I'm using the cartridge for my work. Only problem is the quality of the ink is not very good. Its not as black as a brothers or hp cartridge its more of a faded to charcoal gray color, for me and my customer's its no biggie though. You can't beat the price.
