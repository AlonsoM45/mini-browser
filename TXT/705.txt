Pros: Can be used as an AP, Router, or Repeater. 4 SSID's (Guests) and option to limit bandwidth. Rang far exceeds expectations which was my MAIN issue :). Easy to use GUI and to updates are easy and painless to install.Cons: LED indicator lights aren't as bright but not a big issue.Other thoughts: Using it as an Access Point linked up to original router via Powerline. Signal is great as I can reach it from the opposite side of a split level house as well as the basement. The GUI itself is really easy to navigate and self explanatory if you've never done that sort of thing before. 4 ssids are awesome to seperate the kids if one only reads books online or when playing games. Not the best router for streaming HD video but we had 5 devices with youtube going at 720p there were no issues. So far so good I say. If you're looking for something cheap and it works this is it.
