Mabel and  Jack have moved from the comforts of home and family in 1920's Pennsylvania  to take up homesteading in Alaska.  Having given birth to a stillborn child  ten years earlier,  Mabel,  still childless, finds the noisy chatter of children and adult talk of parenthood at family gatherings  painful reminders of her own loss.  Lured by the hopes of a fresh start in the quiet solitude of the Alaskan wilderness, neither she nor Jack are prepared for the harsh realities of trying to survive and make a living there.Late on the eve of the first snowfall,  Mabel  ventures outside.  Jack follows her, and they build  a snow child in the image of a little girl.  They adorn her with scarf and mittens and go back inside. The next morning, Jack is puzzled when he sees the  fleeting figure of a young girl dart through the trees. He is even more perplexed when he notices that the snow child has crumbled and the scarf and mittens are gone.  And it is at this moment that the enchantment begins.In eloquent and vivid detail,  Eowyn Ivey seamlessly weaves together the physical and the ethereal in her updated version of an old Russian fairy tale. Graphic descriptions of the wilds of Alaska magically  transport the reader there, while the story's characters, including the spritely snow child Faina, seem to be as real as  one's next-door neighbors.  Ivey  delivers the story in such a way that the implausible seems plausible, that reality and fantasy are one,  and that anything is possible if you believe in it.
