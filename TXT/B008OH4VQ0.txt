Great size for making fondue etc. I used for melting chocolate for dipping peanut butter balls and found setting on low side about 3 to 4 dots up worked best. Use oil in bottom when melting chocolate morsels so not to scorch or etc. Stainless cleans up very good, i was sad to see it was not dishwasher safe and recommended hand washing but that was no big deal. Came with the 4 dipping spears with different colors on the end.
