Loftek is an awesome product! I recently bought a IP camera loftek CXS2200 and was impressed at its practical function and Tech support. How easy it was to set up. Just follow the directions provided or go to their website. If ever you are having some issues, you can always contact them and you are guaranteed a response from them.My wife and I were so impressed that we bought another camera,we are setting it up so we can monitor our child at home even when we are away. The camera come with a factory ddns .It is very convininet for user to view the camera on our phone. Moreover it's hard to ignore it's alarm trigger and video recording trigger. I can receive a alarm email when someon break into my home.Big two thumps up! Cost and Quality is great!
