I just received a set of Japanese Hiragana and Katakana flash cards by Glen McCabe as recently revised by Professor Emiko Konomi.  I am really impressed, both by the low price and by the overall quality and value of the set.  The real usefulness of a set like this is in the way it can facilitate the speed and accuracy of character recognition.  I'm looking forward to using it this way.  The cards are plastic coated, so they won't get "funky" like the ones I made for myself some time ago.  Each card has a series of words written in kana, which aids in the reading of whole words.  One of the most important features involves a high quality CD that comes with the cards.  Using the CD in conjunction with the cards allows the learner to completely avoid using roomaji, and go directly from the Japanese character to the correct Japanese pronunciation.  The 200 cards include the so-called "twisted sounds" as well as the "voiced" sounds.  There are also wall charts of the characters, which, sad to say, I still find necessary on occasion.  For the beginner, such charts would be of great value.  I am currently teaching "Scientific Communication in English" at the Tokorozawa Campus of Waseda University.  I am a colleague of Konomi-sensei at Portland State University and have also been a student in a Japanese class in which she was the instructor.  She is truly a master teacher, and has used her considerable skills to produce a valuable and useful aid in the flash card set.
