I was slightly disappointed with this product because all the lipsticks look the same on me... bright pink. They are good in the fact that they moisturize and stain my lips for a long time. They are good if I wear one and then apply a real lipstick over it so if my actual lipstick fades, my lips will be stained from this product.
