This is probably my favorite watch i own; it goes well with almost any outfit. Its a classy looking watch with a great face design; i love the fact that the black has a carbon fiber ish look to it as well the two sub dials which gives the face an even more intricate look. Functionality wise the watch is easy to read and chronograph works prefect too. All in all this is probably the best watch iv ever bought and the one that i wear the most often.
