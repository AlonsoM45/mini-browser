As posted by reviewers before me, the book is kind of a run-of-the-mill fantasy novel. It's good, not great. It's fun to read at times, but at others it's a little painful. I would recommend it because it's free, if it weren't I wouldn't waste more than a few dollars on it. I don't know how the books after this in the series play out, but I plan on getting the next one to see how it plays out. The book has potential, now all that's left to do is see if the author acts on it. (If the author had a better editor the book could have been amazing, just sayin')
