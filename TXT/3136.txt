This book is actually two stories. L.E. Modessit's first major novel was "The Fires of Paratime"; this contains that story and its later-written prequel. I've been looking for this book in print for a VERY long time, but now I have the Kindle version on my tablet AND my Android phone! This is a must-read for all sci-fi fans!!!!!!!
