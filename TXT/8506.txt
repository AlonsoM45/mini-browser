Hi guys, I am Aistis and was following Randy Gage for some time. I got a chance (thank you Randy) to read his new book, which is coming on 30th of October, beforeit is released. I was shocked, amazed and fascinated of the vision Randy shares with us. This book is much different from many success literature, it is something different I even expected from Randy. The main message Randy wants to share in this book is to cause us to think. In this book he does not tell us anything what or how to think, by telling all those thing he just causes us to think. And in my mind that is the reason this book is a must read for everybody who can read letters!!!Risky is the new safe sound really strange for many people, it simply denies everything we were taught to know. But it is TRUE. World have changed and rules of life have changed and now no lifestyle is safe until it is RISKY. Life tempo is getting faster and faster and many people never stop to see what is coming and what are those changes bringing them - problems or opportunities. And in my opinion this is one of the reasons why you guys should really get a copy of this book for yourself and for ones you love. For some of you it will be shocking and mindblowing. Others will find the answers to their questions like I did. Some of you guys will get a million dollar idea. I believe there will be ones that will throw this book in the corner after reading. I think every choice is acceptable, but give yourself a chance to see the world upside down.Prepare to get a lot of information that is unusual to you. You will choose to believe it or not, to admit it or resist. The fact is many things will happen despite of our will and our role is to see an opportunity in whatever is happening!!!I would like to share with you my favourite Randy's message: "You must be willing to let go of who you are to become who you are meant to be", - Randy GageEnjoy your reading guys!!
