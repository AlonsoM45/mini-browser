I just got done reading this book.  I'm crying and just wow.  There is so much I want to say but I won't.  All I will say is read this book.  The only part I didn't like was the prologue.  It was just wow.  Loved Parker in this, he was so great.  Anyone that has gone through cancer or seen someone with it knows how hard it is.  I want to thank Amanda for giving us such a great book.
