The water itself is nice and comes out in a nice mist on the face. Good for setting make-up. However, for me, the bottle broke when I was about 1/4 of the way through using it, so now it is basically useless with a lot of wasted product. Perhaps the smaller bottles would work better (I have the 300mL/10.5 oz).
