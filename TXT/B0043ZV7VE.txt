Just what I was looking for.  Had a railroad watch many years ago.  When I needed a new watch, I started looking for a new model.  Although a little hard to find, this model is perfect.  Good size, not too big, light weight, easy to read.I did follow other users tip to fully charge the watch prior to use, it's working great.The Amazon purchase process was also easy and good, delivered right on time.
