I was very excited about this planter. I got this planter to give as a Christmas present due to the fact that my mother has 4 pugs. When I received the huge box I was very excited only to find out that there was a much smaller box. That box had the pug planter in it. Disappointed I paid that price for that small of a planter. I do love the fact that is resembles a pug very well since how a lot things dont. I am overall happy with the product. I only wish that I knew it wwas going to be that small.
