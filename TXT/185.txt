I checked the internet for along time to find just the right camera bag at a good price.This bag is perfect for my Nikon 3200 with 2 lens.I even put my digital video camera in it and still have room for more stuff.Some day I'll buy a tablet to put in it also.The price of this bag even with shipping and tax was a steal.Amazon's price was 5 dollars less then the supplier was asking.It shipped really fast to my local post office.
