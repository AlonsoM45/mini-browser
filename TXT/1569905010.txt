This book contributes nothing new to advance my understanding of plastics processing, I was disappointed to see some sections shorted when a more detailed discussion could have been provided. Some topics I feel are important were skimmed over in a paragraph or so.This book would be good for a new student (less than 3 years experience) that wants an 'overview' to plastic processing.
