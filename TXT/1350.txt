These are indeed the best lights I ever owned. no tangling or muss love the case they come in for storage as well. Just wish there were multi color lights in this length as well. I am replacing on my old lights with these rope lights I use mine when camping but since we don't camp much in winter I am using them at christmas as well to decorate my porch. you can't loose with this purchase.
