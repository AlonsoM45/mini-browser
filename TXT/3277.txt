I was very hesitant on starting this book since it was based of an marriage relationship gone wrong, since I am more of a mystery thrillers fan. But this book surprised me page after page. Gillian flynn's writing has an absolute new take on how a individual could think about their life partner, so much as that makes you feel a chill running down your spine. In the middle before i reached part two of the book, I didn't know if I should empathize or sympathize with the narrator. Since both the characters take turns on every chapter to have their very own personal view on marriage (which I loved), Gillian knew how to play with her words and form her own visions of dramatization.Since everyone had given their own personal synopsis on the story I wouldn't dwell on it much.It is a dark thriller which makes us question who do we really know in our lives?Can any of us be the true self and not a facade of personalities we try to pretend?Go for it if you like any sort of Dark mysteries.
