If you're like me and happen to run out of space with only about 4 games left sitting on your shelf, this card is a great choice. It might not have a ton of space like other cards here on Amazon, but it's officially-licensed and it works perfectly. No problems, and fast delivery. If you need a little more space for your game collection, you can't go wrong with this.
