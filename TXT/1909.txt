This is the best ever like I mentioned on another review I ordered 3 so far 2gueen&1full..easy and quick assembly my 16 mth old granddaughter helped ,,does not make noise ,,very strong,, but then noticed after I started to order by third one the price had went up tremendously..high in demand now ..I was gonna order more as gifts for others not affordable now..All- in- all still 5*
