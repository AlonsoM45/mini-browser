I bought this battery to replace the original battery for my Samsung SGH-I727 Galaxy II Skyrocket, and it works perfectly. I had to remove the sticker for the battery cover to close correctly, but I knew what I was getting myself into before I even bought it. The charge time takes a little longer, as expected, but having the extra battery life is well worth it.
