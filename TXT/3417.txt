I absolutely love my kindle fire HDX. It's quality is amazing, the screen resolution is great. The features are perfect. The only downside is that it doesn't have a huge selection of apps. But other than that it's perfect. The movies look amazing on this, and the speakers sound great. For the price, this is a steal. It's also super fast.
