i have order 3 of these and they are all different! I ordered a medium it fit like a small. ordered a large...it was different &#34;fur&#34; and fit like an xxl so i had to get it tailored.....ordered another one in an xxl AND IT WAS SMALLER THAN THE MEDIUM I ORDERED THE FIRST TIME. . waste of money. if the product was consistently the same the vest would be great.
