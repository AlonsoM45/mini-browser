If you are not a Pepper fan, what can I tell you? They are a fun loving, 420 friendly, p*ssy loving band. They are kind of Ragae, Ska with some punk notes thrown in. You can rock out, as well as chill out with this one. If you ARE a Pepper fan, then you need this album just like ALL of their albums!!!LONG LIVE PEPPER!
