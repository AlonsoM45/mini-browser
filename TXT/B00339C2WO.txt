This flashlight is awesome!! I use it for hunting and it shines through the woods like crazy! I had one a couple years back but left the batteries in it all year and the inside started to corrode. But it was so good I ordered another one! The batteries last a long time in them too! Small and compact... Perfect for anywhere!
