I own a few Condor items: bags, pouches, chest rig... this was the first jacket.  I was a little nervous about buying it online, without actually &#34;seeing&#34; it and putting it on, but I did it.  And I'm glad I did.  I've only had it a couple weeks, but so far I like it. I think for the price, it really gives a lot.  I needed something that would be wind resistant, and offer rain resistance, that was lightweight and breathable. I think this jacket covers all of those needs.  I don't believe it is waterPROOF, but I think it's resistant enough for what I intend to use it for: Hunting, shooting, backpacking in Hawaii.As others have said in their reviews, the zippers as quality as I'd like, but they're ok.  I didn't see any frayed seams or anything like that, and the jacket seems to be well constructed.  For a sub $100 jacket, I think it's well worth the money.Don't compare this to a North Face, Columbia or Patagonia jacket...that's not what this is. You won't get THAT kind of quality and weather resistance in this jacket that's half the price!  Nor is this jacket mil-spec. Don't expect that either.It's an $89 jacket that offers a LOT for that $89 bucks!
