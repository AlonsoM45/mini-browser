I did some searching as far as benchmarks.  This was one of the highest ranked AMD processors.  There were some higher ranged Intel ones so I looking into them first.  The prices were way more than what I was willing to spend.  I ordered this along with a Thermaltake Water 2.0 PRO/All In One Liquid Cooling System CLW0216.  Placed it on a AM3+ board, fired it up and nothing... Windows 7 would not boot.  I installed a new copy of Windows 7 and it worked perfectly.  I used Handbreak to compare my before and after.  My previous system, a 2500MHz AM2+ system, would do about 132 fps.  Now I get 315 fps.  For the effort/price, this was a great purchase.
