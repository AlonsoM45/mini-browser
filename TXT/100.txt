I'm a newbie with USB sticks. Got to thinking it would be neat if I could convert an entire DVD movie to a SINGLE Mpeg file. Found a program that does that. Ok, NOW I have an entire movie on a little stick and in the process all the dvd files were compressed a lot with no noticable loss in video or audio quality! Trouble was NOW I'd like to view this on my tv. Did some looking and found this thing.My only complaints are that the usb and flash card ports are upside down and it should have come with an HDMI cord. But luckily I had one on hand so all went easy and fast. So far I have two movies on one 16 gig stick with room for 4 to 6 more (depending on movie length). So far, quite happy.
