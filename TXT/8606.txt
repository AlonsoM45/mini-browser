We received different colors as shown above...bright orange with blue stitching, light blue with bright orange stitching and dark blue. They fit my 9 year old perfectly. He weighs about 66 pounds and around 48 inch tall. I got him size mediums and the fit is perfect. The material is a little thin, but he loves them. I will definitely buy these again.
