Good god paul anderson, i am a long fan of resident evil and your lovely wife Milla but this film kinda sucked. It did take alot from the game some but some of the action scenes were cheesy, and i could tell some makeup on zombies was poor. The story line seems all messed up as well and was confusing from the start, milla falls in water wakes up in umbrella.....fights and kills the main guy from last movie but yet at ends fights on his side and now given the t-virus again?? I can see that this is leading up to going back to the hive to fight the &#34;changed appearance&#34; the &#34;red queen&#34;. Why could you not leave some things as they are. kudos on milla still pulling off her hotness but in the last film please paul get help!
