I purchased these lanyards as gifts for my grandson and his friends.  They loved them and liked to wear them with theirpocket knives on them when we went out in the woods hunting and exploring.  The very first day, the hook on two of thelanyards came apart.  The seller sent us replacement ones and I hope that they last.  The lanyards are great but the hookhardware is very cheap and does not last.  Seller is easy to work with and very helpful.
