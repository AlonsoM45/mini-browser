I've used the product before with excellent results. This time it is taking longer than normal. Maybe I don't have enough roaches and am not putting enough out. It worked wonderfully when I used it at my father's apartment before he passed away. He was so sick that he couldn't clean his apartment and the roaches were out of control. When I came into town the first weekend and used the product, It killed about 75% of the roaches. Of course we cleaned the apartment which also helped. The next weekend about 90% of the roaches were gone. My mom loves the product and my second mom love the product. (I have to get it for everyone).
