Ok so this light is NOT 400 lumens.  I&#699;m not sure how they&#699;re getting that...but it&#699;s probably not even 200 lumens.  My Olight T25 which I received in the same order is listed at 210 lumens, and it blows this 400 lumen light away. Next thing that was a little odd: This little flashlight arrived in NO packaging other than a little bubble wrap bag, which was inside of a brown shipping envelope.  There were no packaging or invoice paperwork, no directions, no nothing... But I knew that was probably going to happen based on other reviews I&#699;ve read on this light.  The light is decently bright.  Didn&#699;t blow my socks of by any means.  It&#699;s compact, runs on a single AA battery, and has a decent clip on it.  The focus feature is...nothing really.  I just keep it on it&#699;s brightest setting and leave it.  To cycle between modes you have to quickly press the on/off switch.  I like that it stays in the last mode you had it in.With that being said... I paid 7 bucks for this light with free shipping, and it arrived ahead of schedule, and in great condition.  I cannot really complain because I knew exactly what I was getting.  I gave it 3 stars because it&#699;s just ok.  Nothing special.  Just a decent Cree LED flashlight that runs on a single AA battery.  I would probably buy a couple more to give to my wife/kids to keep in their car/purse/bag. It&#699;s small enough that it doesn&#699;t get in the way too much.
