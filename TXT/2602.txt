This product is very well manufactured.  Most fish oil pills have oil on the outside of the pill, I assume from the manufacturing process, and taste like freezer burned fish.  Not these.  No fishy taste in the mouth when you take it or any later that I've noticed.  Excellent product and will buy again.
