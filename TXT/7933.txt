Both of my kids birthdays are in Feb so I ordered this when I ordered my first daughters gifts for the beginning of the month. Her birthday went by and then my second daughters came. I wrapped this, she opened it, Dad was in charge of getting it out of the pkg and working and he couldnt get it to work. Nothing. So I tried to return or replace it and I cant because the window has gone by......thats nice. Now my daughter has a birthday gift that doesnt work. Im dissapointed because most everything I get from Amazon is right on. Hopefully no one else gets a bum microphone like we did.
