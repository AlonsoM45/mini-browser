It's good because it has oatmeal in it, and it has no smell which is plus! It does however leave my skin with a greasy sticky feeling that i don't care for, but it does help with my dry skin after showers and for general stuff. I do know oatmeal is a good natural moisturizer so it works. As far as Eczema, I would not know if it helps or not.
