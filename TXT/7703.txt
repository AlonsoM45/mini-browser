Once the action starts, it doesn't let up. Zombie fans like me will definitely enjoy it. The story is plausible and the zombies are more realistic than some of the ones you find in other books. Lee, the main character, is realistic enough so you develop empathy and root for him. Put it this way, it's good enough for me to buy the remaining books, pun intended.
