This is my first trainer, so I&#8217;m not familiar with the noise level of other trainers. I know this one is very loud, so loud; I must turn the sound level on the TV very high to hear the TV. I have it in the garage, so it doesn&#8217;t bother anyone. I do not recommend this product if you are living around (apartment) or with someone.
