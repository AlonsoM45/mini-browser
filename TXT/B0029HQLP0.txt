I have been looking for colorful affordable pashmina scarves for a while now and I am so glad I cam across these!!! I ordered 3- deep orange, lime green, and almost silver. They are extremely soft and the colors are beautiful. But the best part is that the shipping was so fast. They came in a week after I ordered them! Thumbs up for these :)Oh, and the length is perfect too, so many ways you can tie them!Very satisfied :D
