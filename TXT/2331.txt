This game sucks. It's got a similar set up to Mario but the controls are awful. Half the time when u go to jump you'll just stop moving and fall straight down. Sometimes you can correct and other times you just die. Whoever likes this game obviously is delusional or hasn't actually played Mario or is making there review based on a very young child playing the game. I hate this game and my 6yr old won't even play it. It does work though but if your expectations are very high you won't like it at all
