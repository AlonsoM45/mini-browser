If you have ever owned a pen-lite like the ones we used to keep on our key chains, this is exactly what you get here. It may be a bit longer, but does not put out any more light than that. I purchased it to put over my laptop for a little additional keyboard illumination, and it was essentially useless. I hung it just a little over 12 inches above the keyboard and found that I might as well keep it off for all the good it does. Also, I had to scotch tape the light in its base otherwise it just falls out. This should be a novelty in a dollar store, nothing more. WAY over priced. I can not recommend this product at all. The fact that the batteries don't last very long either is a mute point since I don't bother to use it any more.
