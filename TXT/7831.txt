I'd give this a fourth star if it were edited better. The overall content was good. Being a believer in herbs made this read a simple one. It covers the basics and is organized well.  I would like to have seen the use of the Latin names especially for plants like passion flower, horsetail since they are several species within the genera. But overall all an honest 3.5 start book. Enjoy!
