Updated review:After 5 months using this mat, I'm very impressed.Its easily cleaned and now the mat is flat on the floor, i didn't even do anything to straighten it!Love this mat! I'm planning to get another one for my husband's office.I'm looking for a sturdy clear plastic to cover my hardwood floor from my daughter's messy eating habit.The other kids floor covers are either flimpsy or has kidddy pattern.This mat works great because it allows the crumbs to dry and i can just sweep or wipe. So much easier to clean than hardwood floor.The only downside is the wrinkles that comes from folding it in the box when it was delivered.I'm not sure how can i make it straight but for now it works okay for us.
