I encourage people to get a copy of Bird Face. Cynthia Toney realistically captures what it feels like to be in junior high, wrestling with discovering who you are and finding where you fit. Wendy has to work through some of her own problems and insecurities while addressing some tough issues that her classmates struggle through. I like how Wendy finds her courage to do what is right for herself and others and how she grows and is blessed by her decisions. I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to reading more by Cynthia Toney.Posted by Michelle Welsh
