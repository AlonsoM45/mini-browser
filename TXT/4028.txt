Fed Ex goofed on my order a little and i was confused and wrote the seller. within i hr of e-mail he called me and even tracked my package for me. Delivery was quick and i got to say i love this rack. Doing bench out of this rack is wonderful for powerlifters as the brackets are minimal depth so you can rocket into press position without readjusting your shoulderblades, minimizing wasted energy from unracking into the start postion. same with squats. there are many holes, very close to each other allowing for some very fine tuning on start position of your lifts. Great product amazing deal for what you pay and a seller who works hard to take care of you. i will come back to him soon
