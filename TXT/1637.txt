I chose 3 stars because it was hard to mount on the wall. It was crooked when I received it. But I made it work. Plus wish it came with the bottles that fit in because the ones I have are too small and topple over. I mean you can fit any spice bottles in it but the bottle are sold separately which I don't feel like paying $30 for spice bottles.
