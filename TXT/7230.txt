I absolutely loved this book! They're story was way before my time, but it doesn't matter, because some stories are so great! there just timeless!I remember hearing references to Martin & lewis through out my life, but didn't know who they were. I found out later after got into Frank Sinatra. I would watch all there movies and watch any program I could find about them. But sadly they usually featured people who knew them and were around them during there comedy partnership...I wanted to hear it straight from the horses mouth!When I heard about this book, I couldn't wait to read it! It covered everything, how they met, there relationship, and why they "called it quits". I have to be honest, it was like I was getting a behind the scenes of there life at that time! and at times it was like I was there!I recommend this book to anyone who was aware or even slighly interested in these two amazing talents!!
