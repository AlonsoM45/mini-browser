I've read every single one of David Dalglish's novels and short-stories to date, and with every single one I find something new and exciting. While this is a re-publish of his earlier books, it's an updated, upgraded version. The story now has a lot more depth and consistency, and over all is just better quality than the previous ones. Which isn't to say the others were bad, they were great, just that this is an improvement ;) If you've read the other books before these, read these. They're somewhat pricey for a kindle novel, but it's worth every single penny. Just so you know, I'm not just a Dalglish fanboy, I only support author whom I believe have talent and skill, both of which and more Dalglish has.
