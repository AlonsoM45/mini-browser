I work as a welder in a steel fabrication shop. I do a lot of arc gouging and welding and after a year these boots are still in great shape.  They were easy to break in and were comfortable from the first day. They are steel toe and metaltarsal is built on inside which is one reason I bought them. When these wear out I will be getting another pair. I highly recomend these boots.
