I usually buy my Lanza shampoo at the beauty shop-but decided to try it on line and somethings wrong with this shampoo-it does not lather up and it wont even go in my hair when washing my hair-it's in the same bottle that i get from my beauty shop-but whatever is inside the bottle is not the same stuff.  I love Amazon and I order all the time-but not happy with this bottle that I received from Mrs Goodeal's shampoo.
