I enjoyed this book so much.  I felt as though I was there with the Benders in Paradise Valley.  I have so much respect for the Amish people.  We have several families here in Northern Maine, and they have gained the respect for all who know them.  Dale is an awesome author.  It is not every author who can make a book come alive as you read such as he has.
