Pron: I'm so happy i got mine today, but I'm disappointed because it's not working :(Con: I hook up the cable on my phone and I'd notice that there's a gap like .5 centimeter, meaning it doesn't fit all way in, propably thats the problem? Even though, it says on the description of this product it works on s3 and I'm using s3.Is there anyway to refund my money back or change the product?
