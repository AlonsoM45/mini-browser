It was Nylon, first of all, not fiberglass as advertised.  Secondly, I was using this to mend scratches to my titanium watch and when i used it, not only did it not fix the existing scratches, it just scratched the watch more.  It was not at all what I wanted and I should have looked at the other reviews before buying this..I needed one and it was cheap so I got it without really doing any background research....lesson learned.  Don't buy this.
