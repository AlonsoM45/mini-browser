This went on easy and is touch as nails. My kids could destroy an anvil with a rubber hammer and they cant manage to tear this up. They did break the screen on one nabi but this screen protector is holding the broken pieces together and they are still able to use the nabi.Once you start getting decent screen protectors for your electronics you will see the value in them.
