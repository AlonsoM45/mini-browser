I'M STILL KIND OF IN SHOCK.Let me start off my saying this is not your typical story, it isn't a fairytale. I was a bit ify about this read at first, I'm not going to lie. BUT that quickly changed! I was sucked into Lilian's life, her thoughts, her struggles, her good times, her bad times, and all of her choices. Her story was so real, and so raw, and I loved every bit of it. It was like I was with her the whole time! When it came to her relationships I was in love with Leo, I loved them together. But I also loved Nick. It's a tough choice but Leo has my heart. He was there for her, he saved her. He is Lilian's happily ending. I was really rooting for Nick and Lil to work, I was kind of jealous she scored a man like that! But everything happens for a reason, and somehow someway Leo and Lil ended up together again after 20 years.Everything that Lil went through hurt my heart, so many highs and lows had me turning the page and turning the page. It was an emotional rollercoaster. Life was good to Lil then it was cruel. They always say you should let these bad times make you stronger but that's not always the case. Sometimes life can hit you time after time and you start to become weak. She dealed with a lot, I felt for her. I sometimes wanted to take some of her pain away.Overall this book was simply great. I was left speechless, I won't be able to pick up another book for a while. It was a rollercoaster of emotions, of pain, happiness and everything in between. It's gritty and so real. This is Lil's story and I know there will be a book 2 with Leo's POV. I would reccemond this read to those who love a good ugly ugly emotional cry.
