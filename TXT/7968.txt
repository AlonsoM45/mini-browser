When I was deciding to buy this I really couldn&#699;t tell from the pic what it looked like...because HELLO??!!!  The pic is showing the INSIDE (belt loop side) of the pouch!!!  Why they did that I have no idea!!  BUT... once I got it...it was EXACTLY what I wanted.  It&#699;s a dual mag plastic pouch, and it holds my mags (Glock 17) in place very well. It has a nice fit where the mags slide in firmly. I loaded 2 full double stack mags and turned it upside down and shook it...and yes, after a couple of shakes the mags did fall out...however, how many of you are planning to do a handstand and jiggle your magazines out??! It works folks.  And the price is decent and it&#699;s fairly &#34;low profile&#34;  and isn&#699;t a big bulky holder.  I believe the screw that you see between the two magazines is a tension screw and will put more tension on the mags.  I haven&#699;t tried it yet, but I don&#699;t see the need at the moment.  I&#699;m happy with how it holds my magazines.OH...AND you can set both magazines facing the same direction for easy/quick reloads.  I know there is another mag pouch out there where you can only put them in facing the opposite direction.  I don&#699;t like that.  I&#699;d rather them be set up so I can pull and load in one quick motion...without having to worry about turning one.For the price I paid, and what I got...it&#699;s 5 *&#699;s for me!
