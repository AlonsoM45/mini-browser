Good reading about starting and developing business. I think this book really can serve you as a guide if you want to start your own business but don't know where and how to start. It covers important aspects like targeting your group, getting traffic, gathering information, selling, upselling and what it is very important - loving and relating to your customers. Daryl also talks about the importance of complains and how to handle them. What I really got from this book is that being the best in you sphere is not everything, being the best for your customers is everything.It's simple, easy readable and understandable and if you want to start you own business it's an excellent guide to use!
