This book has made me feel so much better! Ive been through a lot of testing to figure out whats wrong with me. I was terrified I had MS.. I started this diet because my blood tests showed I had inflammation and I figured it could only help. My chronic pain and cramping began to disappear. I lost 12 lbs in the first 10 days! The only complaint I have is that its a hard program to stick to 100%. I made a few minor tweaks to the recipes and gained. But as soon as I got back on it I dropped the gained weight quickly.
