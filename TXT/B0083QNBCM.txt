I ordered these brushes because I didn't want to spend a fortune on an acrylic brush,good price, The brushes came  very fast it came before the set date, Brush Size: #4, #6, #8, #10, #12, It is safe and easily to be used, ready to try them out in a few days, only i got one brush that is not the same like the others, colorful handles makes it fun to work with them, but at the end, i'm happy with my order.
