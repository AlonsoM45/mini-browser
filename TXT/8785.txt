when I first started taking this it seemed to be working pretty well. I lost 5 pounds in about 2weeks, but I also eat very healthy and I work out almost daily.  So that  didn't exactly send me to the moon or anything but it was definitely encouraging. I started out taking the 3pills a day like it says, and I got SEVERLY constipated. So I cut back to one a day and slowly worked my way back up. The consipation comes and goes now but its There more often than not. I've been taking this product now for almost a month and not only have I not lost an ounce, I gained back the 5 pounds that I lost. It doesn't seem to be doing anything at all at this point. Which is dissapointing because I have struggled with my weight for so long even though I eat right and exercise so I thought this could be the answer I was searching for but sadly, i have found that the old saying holds true, if it sounds to good to be true, it probably is. I will continue to take the pills until they are gone just in case I suppose but overall I'm not really pleased. Especially for the $$
