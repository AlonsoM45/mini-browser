It does what it's supposed to. This isn't a complicated item. It's simple. The snap closure is really tight and definitely needs a tight leather belt to be secured to. If you have a bit of "belt hang over" your body type might make it difficult to access. It's hard to pull a lighter out if any angular pressure is put on it. You must slide lighter strait out. Good product!The snap broke off.
