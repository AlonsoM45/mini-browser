I got my case yesterday and it fits very well. I have 2 complaints though...I don't know what it's been kept in or what but there's an odor that's almost unbearable! The other thing is I'm not fond of the stylus pen. I think it should be easier to use like the one that came with my Samsung Galaxy Note II.
