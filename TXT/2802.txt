There was nothing about this costume I didn't like. It was extremely comfortable, cute, warm, and everyone loved it! I wore it to a Halloween party and it was perfect for the outdoor bonfire. Even better, I've also worn it as pajamas for the cold Minnesota winter nights. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a fun and functional costume!
