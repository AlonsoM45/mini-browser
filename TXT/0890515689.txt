This book focuses primarily on the logical assumptions of evolution rather than on the data.  As the author points out, often both evolutionists and creationists agree on the facts but not on the interpretation because of difference of worldviews.  This book is helpful in understanding basic issues confronting the evolutionist/creationist controversy.Robert Patton, MD
