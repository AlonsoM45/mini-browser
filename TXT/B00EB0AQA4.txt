this product is good i heard about it, from other womans, After I did my research when I had my miscarriage and I have pcos but, my doctor won't give me anything because they feel as if I got pregnant I'm fine. But once I bought this cream and can say my night sweats have gone and I stop it and notice it came back so yes it does work and I will contuie to buy this product....
