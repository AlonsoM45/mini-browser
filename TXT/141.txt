What a delightful read! Carol has hit the nail with the hammer, dead bang on! I thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful book, well written and very insightful, not to mention the wit and humor that accompany the sound advice. There is much to be said for many of the suggestions that she has offered, and I truly believe both men and women should take the time to read this book for sure. Very helpful and informative when it comes to understanding the opposite sex.
