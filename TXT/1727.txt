If you buy the tulip kit this book probably covers what's in each kit.  I found this book to be sparse. I expected to see a pic at end of each project. Especially since some were done in different colors from beginning pic. Gave four stars because it is what it says. Unfortunately what isn't said is that it is one long tulip tie dye commercial.
