It's not everyone's kind of music, but dam does it go in hard with really addictive beats harmonies, and powerful words. if you never liked Rundgren before, this album is a good reason to. he's an innovator. the technology aspect to the cd feels primitive compared to nowadays, buts still interesting to remix the vocals and beats, not to mention this stuff was cutting edge back in the day.  it also came really fast and in the original package too, always a good thing.
