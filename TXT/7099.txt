This ring is super pretty and has the "look" of being close to authentic although the stones around the center are small and need cleaning often. I would definitely recommend to everyone to buy CZ and not real diamonds. Real diamonds lose their value and you'll never get retail price or even close. Save your money! The issue I have with this ring is after 3 months, the center stone fell out. Just looked down one day and it was gone. Make sure to check the prongs regularly and don't expect much from a ring under $50.
