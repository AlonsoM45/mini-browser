This movie had the same title as the one I'm looking for but this wasn't it.  Back in the 1980's I saw a Hidden Agenda movie that had no Americans in it and the topic was more IRA related.  The main character was English.  I do not recall his name.  The items offered with this title did not match the subject matter I was looking for.The movie I purchased was good but not what I was looking for.
