Excellent delivery service, product arrived before expected, and the leash tape is a very bright, visible-in-evening yellow. However, unlike the product description states, the leash housing (what you hold onto) is not reflective, it's just silver and shiny. And unlike with my other Flexi leashes, this one has no 1-2ft. non-retractable extension hanging out; i.e. when your dog is standing next to you, this leash still "pulls," while other Flexi leashes have 1-2ft of limp leash that won't retract into the housing. That's a great thing because the leash goes slack (and doesn't pull on him or your hand/arm) when your dog is right next to you at a crosswalk or whatever.  Still, this is a great safety leash for evening walking. Just wish the housing itself was bright and reflective. I bought two of these leashes and I've received comments on them from passersby. Most importantly, at night cars can see that your dog is ON a leash.
