Just got today. Has AMAZING quality to it. Let me start out by saying that it arrived very very quickly, and in perfect boxing. Took it out to find an owners manual and the product. Very easy and simple to connect blue-tooth keyboard. Ipad snaps right in place easy with no hassle. Provides great protection for it and definitely would look forward to getting another one of New Trent's items. 5 stars all the way. Keyboard seems a little small for my hands, but im sure i will adjust quite easily.Bottom line.Amazing quality for an amazing price
