It's ok i guess it seems to work more than Kaspersky at controlling your pc and life. I don't like how long it takes customer service to get back with you and some features on it doesn't make sense and other parts are lacking. More intrusive than kaspersky but again i think the Romanian side is more advanced than the russian side of AV.
