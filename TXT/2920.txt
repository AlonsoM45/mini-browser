My five year old son loves it. I bought this for Christmas a year ago. Unfortunately he broke the screen about the four months later and I had to buy another one. He plays with the tablet almost daily. I would suggest getting the rechargeable batteries and downloading th apps instead of the cartridges. I don't have to worry about him dropping the cartridges and breaking them. Plus it's easy to switch the downloaded apps to a new learning tablet.
