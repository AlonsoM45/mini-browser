I had severe lower back pain starting at 10 weeks of pregnancy. I see both a chiropractor and a physical therapist because of the extreme pain. They both suggested this pillow. At first a was not interested, but I am so glad I invested in it!!! I can now sleep at night without the fear of feeling like my back is going to break. I am now 6 months pregnant. This pillow did not magically cure me, but it does make me more comfortable! I love it!
