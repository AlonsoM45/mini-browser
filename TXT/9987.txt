I've been using this product since the mid 1990's. It is without a doubt the best way to keep lips exfoliated from dry patches and chapping. Be sure to use the &#34;mask&#34; generously and let it dry completely. The more you use, and the drier it gets, the better the result. Also make sure your lips are dry and free of balm before applying the mask. When you're sure it's completely dry, rub it off with one or two VERY DRY fingertips until you have removed as much as possible. Then you can rinse the remaining product off and follow up with the balm or any other lip moisturizer. I like to follow it with a lip plumper like Lip Fusion or Buxom. The balm included with the product is fine for immediate moisturizing after the mask, but but I would give it alone only 3 stars.
