its not as bright as the one that comes with the nzxt phantom but its not dim either so yeah. im not much of a geek when it comes to the guts of a pc but i was able to finger it out in about 45 minutes. im disappointed that i couldnt connect it to the other 200mm fan at the top to turn on the leds with the same button in the rear of the case but it comes with its own switch and i fairly certain i can set it up the way i want if i tear apart the pc further than i did just to install it. but its no biggy im sure you techies can do some crazy s*** setup with the fan.
