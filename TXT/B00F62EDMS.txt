I have to give it a 5 star rating because I only paid $39.99 delivered for it. Really the only thing that they could have improved on is the zipper pulls. I fixed that by tying my own with 550 cord (paracord), and they look great, learn how to on youtube if you dont know already.The material is maybe 600D, could be a little thicker especially if your going to load down the large outside pocket. Speaking of pockets its got more than enough of them to keep your stuff organized. I especially like the main compartment dividers and that one of them has a padded compartment for a laptop, touchpad, whatever.I wouldnt have paid full price for it, but if I really had to have it and did pay a hundred or more I wouldnt have felt cheated. At fourty buck delivered it was an incredible deal. I bought one for myself and one to give away. Buy it, you cant go wrong with this bag.
