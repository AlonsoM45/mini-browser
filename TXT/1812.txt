I read this story to my son a few times and we both absolutely love it! My son is attracted to the bold and bright pictures and he loves learning about the different types of birds in the story and is already memorizing their names! As a mommy and a preschool teacher though, I look at the deeper parts of the story of course. There is such a great message about loving and accepting the differences that we find in each other. This is a great lesson that we all strive to teach our children and this story tell that in such a fun and sweet way.
