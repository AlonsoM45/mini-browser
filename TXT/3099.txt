First couple of pages I didn't think no would  get through this book but then I got so into it an  I didn't want to put it down. It made my heart swell and I just love  everything about  it. This  book is.  Keeper for sure for any girl that loves love stories. It's about commitment, denial, heart ache and of course love.
