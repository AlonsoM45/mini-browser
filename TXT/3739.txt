Very comfortable plushy pillow, when it arrived it contained some letter and business card from the company about who they are and what they believe their product should be, which in my book is a really good thing to do. States is veteran owned which is a plus and made in the u.s.a. another plus. The only thing i wish it had was a zipper on it so i could take just a little of the stuffing out, i like a flat pillow.
