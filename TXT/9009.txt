Definitely not the best or worse season of TOS as I have heard from some people. There were only three seasons so I don't know really how to pick a least favorite but if I had to it wouldn't be this one. Or 1 or 2 either... but I digress. Great season of a great show that ended before it should have. My one complaint is that it was '69 and they got cancelled so there isn't really a series finale which is sad because it would have been a good one I'm sure. And it would have made the beginning to Star Trek: The Motion Picture even better. Oh well, still amazing!
