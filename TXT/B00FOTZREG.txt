I'm in love with a kindle book. This one. I fall in love easily, but not always with eBooks as there really is some rubbish out there. This one beats the odds and I'm so glad I took a chance on reading it. The story is so well written that you feel as though you live in Isobel's world. I read it over two days and apart from doing the stuff I really had to do, I didn't put it down. Normally that only happens for me with paper books. I think I'm converted :)
