This  book has opened my eyes to how God wants me to live my life now. I wish I would have used the notes so I could go back and review the things that I need to remember when my life goes in the wrong way and I need to refocus on the scriptures. My sister-in-law told me about Joel Osteen  and how it made her understand things about the Lord and God and how we need to act and understand why things happen. This book has opened my eyes on how to live my best life now.
