LOVE IT!It is the most I have ever spent on a watch, but it was so worth every penny.The Analog syncs with the digital time that you set.Has glow in the dark analog, which i'm pretty sure it doesn't saw that in the review.Digital very easy to read, also easy to set and understand the watch programming.The only thing not good is the light. Can't read the digital with it, and doesn't light up evenly.
