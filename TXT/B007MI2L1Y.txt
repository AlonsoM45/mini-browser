I originally bought 2 of these as Christmas gifts for my parents based on the most favorable reviews of any pillows I read. My parents totally loved them so I decided to purchase 2 more of them for myself. I have to admit that they these are not your typical idea of what you think a pillow would be. They are actually kind of heavy. After a few nights of getting used to them, I ended up really liking them. They are firm which I like in a pillow and they hold their shape really well. I find that I don't toss and turn nearly as much causing me to have a better nights sleep. In conclusion, I would recommend these pillows to anyone who is currently unhappy with their current pillows and willing to try something unconventional.
