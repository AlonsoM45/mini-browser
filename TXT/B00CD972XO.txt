I got this on time and started to use it right out of the box. After it died I charged it for somewhere around 4 hours (until the red light turned green indicating it is fully charged). I then pluged it into my phone which was at 17% and an hour and a half later it died after charging my phone an aditional 72%. I believe this product is worth your money!
