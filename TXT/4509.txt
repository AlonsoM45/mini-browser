Excellent! True to size I'm size 4 I ordered a medium because my hips are wide and my backside isn't small it fits perfectly. The quality is surprisingly great I expected some loose threads but it was perfect! Shipping was fast too. The top part is great because the straps are wide enough for fuller chested women and the bottom is tight but stretchy so it sucks in all the right places! Hope this helped. Don't hesitate to purchase!
