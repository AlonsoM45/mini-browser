did not receive ubs,  cord as it stated it was included.  No instructions as how to get clock off military time and onto regular time. No instructions on how of program or search FM radio stations. I feel that the instruction manual need a LOT OF WORK. A little to technical for the average person with limited computer  tech knowledge..
