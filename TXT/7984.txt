Yes I gave it 5 stars.  It&#699;s bright. Not just bright...I mean BRIGHT.  It throws light far!  I was helping to set up a couple of big party tents for an event this past saturday morning...at 4:30AM, and and everyone there had a flashlight or headlamp.  When I turned this little guy on..I was completely blown away at the amount of light it had.  I got a few good comments when it was on the med setting...and when I turned it on HIGH...it blew EVERYONE away that it could even step up a notch! I&#699;ve got regular alkaline AA&#699;s in it now...and it&#699;s STILL really bright.  I&#699;ll be buying lithium AA&#699;s and we&#699;ll see how long those last in comparison and if the brightness is different.  I personally really like the wide beam and how much light it throws.  I like that it&#699;s so slim and light but packs a wallop of light! I also like the length of the light.  It fits nicely in my hand and I can operate it easily with my thumb on the button.  Because I live in Hawaii, it was important to me that this light be waterproof, and built to last. We&#699;re exposed to heavy rain, hot sun, ocean spray and salt water... so I wanted a light that I could accidently drop in a puddle in torrential rain.With that being said, the only thing I wish it had is a side switch/button to change between modes like my other Olight: M20 Tactical Warrior.  BUT...that&#699;s not a deal breaker by any means, I STILL LOVE this light.  I don&#699;t mind twisting the upper bezel to get it to change modes. I&#699;m glad that it stays in the last mode you left it in. I think the lowest setting is a little TOO low.  I don&#699;t imagine when I&#699;d use it.  I keep it on the med setting.  I know there are comparable flashlights that are A LOT more expensive and made in the US... and even less expensive flashlights...but I really liked Olight&#699;s torture test, and how much abuse they can take.  My M20 has been so good to me, and I have had nothing but good experiences with Olight, purchasing this T25 light was an easy choice. The hardest part was choosing between the T20 or the T25.  I picked the T25 because of it&#699;s length.  I think the T20 is a little too short for me personally.So it gets 5 stars from me, and it was well worth the money.
