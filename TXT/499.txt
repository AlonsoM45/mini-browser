This touching, funny book has superb insights into the bodily senses, politics, marriage, academia, and regional subcultures, among many other things.Underneath the funny barbs, this is a loving tribute to Oregon's special mixture of East and West coasters, environmentalists and anarchists, do-gooders and cynics. And mixed in with the hilarious spoofs of college professors, there are wonderful meditations on what it means to get the insider's point of view. The particular focus is a young politics professor's attempt to get inside the minds of local anarchists, but the insights into this vexed enterprise apply to much of the contemporary world: the vicissitudes of sudden mass movements, celebrities, and scandals, the frantic drive in the mass media and on the internet to uncover everyone's secrets.But of course all this works only because the writing is so good--gorgeous descriptions, attention to sensual details, beautifully evoked scenes and characters. So I'll just end by listing, somewhat at random, a few short examples:..."[He was] divorced for the flair with which he shined his shoes."Joey (mother to son): "I hope Oregon isn't like Israel."Sequoia: "through the body we reach the spirit, heart, and mind, not the other way around."In short, there's a lot going on here!
