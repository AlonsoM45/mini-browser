Received the watch on time. Packed perfectly. Absolutely stunning watch and I have owned everything from Rolex to Breitling. Hamilton delivered on this pilot watch. The case, movement and dial are excellent. The band was a tad short (I have 8 1/4" wrist so that's why). Common problem for me. Anyone with a 7 1/2 wrist the band length will be perfect. Don't hesitate to buy this watch. I was looking at IWC, Ball and this was the perfect choice. I went to our local mall and tried them all on and this watch looks more expensive and has more presence than either of the other two I was considering. This was a decision on style and not driven by finances. I am so thrilled I picked the Hamilton.
