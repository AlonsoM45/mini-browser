I would recommend getting this as soon as possible if you bought the EZ Starter airbrush kit.  The reason is that the cap assembly (the little thingy on the top of the cap that plugs into the airbrush &#34;gun&#34;) that comes with the kit will eventually break. Again, if you look at the picture above, it&#699;s that little tube thing thats attached to the bottle cap.  The one that comes with the EZ kit is made of plastic.  I used my sprayer about 3 times, and on the last time I used it, I was plugging the bottle into the gun, and the little tip broke off!Anyway...long story short:  This one is made of metal, and so is the cap itself. I forsee it lasting much longer than the one that came with the gun, so I bought two of them.  I gave it 5 stars because it&#699;s a simple product that exceeds what I originally had.
