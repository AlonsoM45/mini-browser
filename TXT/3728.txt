This might be good for stadium but too large for a chair use, when mine arrived it had a terrible odor coming from it like plastics or spoiled water although checking it did not show signs of previous ownage or damages. I think it comes that way from factory. The memory foam in it &#34;if any&#34; is less than 1/8th of an inch the rest is stiff foam.
