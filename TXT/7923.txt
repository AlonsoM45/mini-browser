I bought this belt for my husband because he goes thru belts like crazy. I figured I was going to buy a good one that would last. This is it! I will never have to buy him another belt! He has had to adjust to it and get used to how it goes on. (He complained that it took longer to put it on than a normal belt.....big deal it takes an extra 30 seconds!) Anyway, Im so glad I bought it!
