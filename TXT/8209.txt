I ordered Minnetonkas because I heard from several of my close friends that they were very reliable shoes that would be comfortable and cute. So when I finally saved up enough to order them I was excited for them to come. When they came in the mail I tried them on right away and the right foot was VISIBLY BIGGER than the left. It flopped off my foot, and I have full intentions of either exchanging or just completely returning them. I am extremely disappointed.
