I bought this item about a month ago because I was in desperate need of installing an easy access light switch going into my garage. So far this item works great and was fairly easy to install if your handy with a drill and screwdriver to mount the switch on a wall. For me this item is only intended to be temporarily until I can find an electrician to hardwire and install better lighting. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking to easily install a wall switch for lights or other electronics. I would have given this 5 stars but I'm not sure of the battery or long term life of this product though.
