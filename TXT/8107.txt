I LOVE Julie Lessman's new book, Love at any Cost.  This book is ANOTHER AMAZING, SUSPENSEFUL, and PASSIONATE work by Julie Lessman.  I have read all of Julie Lessman's previous books, and this one exceeds the rest.  This book is realistic, has twists and turns, and DEFINITELY NOT PREDICTABLE.  I don't want to spoil anything, but the book had my rapt attention during the whole entire book.  Julie describes everything and makes you feel like you know the characters and setting.  You feel as if you are in the middle of the book while you are reading it.  Julie has the AMAZING ability to portray the characters as if they were your best friends.  I truly love this book and recommend this to anyone and everyone.  Abby R
