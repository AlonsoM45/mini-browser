I love this seat. We chose it for how sturdy it looks and is, cute factor (cow print) was a bonus, and the height/weight limit. This car seat not only looks sturdy, it feels sturdy. It supports my daughter's head well and the plastic isn't flimsy. She falls asleep right away in it too. We didn't use the infant foam as our daughter fit better without it, even with her birth weight at 6lb 8oz and 20.5" long. It fits in our 1999 Subaru forester in a side position with the base, but the front seat has to be all the way forward and that makes it so no one can sit up there. It fits in the middle back seat without the base. It also fits exceptionally well in our 2002 dodge ram quad cab. We don't have the latch system in our vehicles, so we use the seat belt to install it. Not hard at all. Just have to push the base down and get it tight enough. I highly recommend this seat if you are searching for one. It's not overly heavy and bulky. It's bigger than others, but it's also sturdier. It's definitely not too heavy (I'm only 5'3", 120lbs and I can carry it easily).
