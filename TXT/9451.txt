As a medical student,i did abit of research looking for a good product to get,wanting it to be easy to use,accurate (which is vital), built well & highly recommended by other buyers.I also wanted it to last over the years.I settled for this after reading others review & I am extremely satisified & happy with my purchase.Its built of good quality and it feels solid as well.Got it sent by amazon and arrived on time.Has clip at the back of the meter which allows u to clip it to the cuff for easy monitoring as u pump.Would recommend it if u are looking for such a product to purchase.Just be sure to check u are getting the right type of cuff u require as there are various sizes for adults and children.
