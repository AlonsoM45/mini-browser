I chose this case for extra protection, since I have 2 iPad dropped by my children; both resulting in dents on the corners and cracks on the screen.  And those damages occurred despite having regular cases (folder / organizer type).  This time I wanted something sturdier and more rugged.Most of the ones online are too bulky, and I expected to get the same.  I was surprise that this stronger and more protective case (for sure) is in fact more stylish, hip and slick looking than the organizer types.  I love it.
