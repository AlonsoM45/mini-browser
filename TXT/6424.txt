This laptop never worked properly from the beginning.  I thought it was due to my infamiliarity with windows 8, but that ended up not being the case.  My wife and I run nothing too complex...Pictures, excel, word, PPT, web surfing.  Eventually the computer slowed down and we took it to the Best Buy Geek Squad.  They were good and did what they could, but it ended that a new hard drive was required.  I know a hard drive is not expensive, but I figure why throw more money at a machine that sucked when it was new?Note: I have a different Lenovo for work that works like a champ.
