I installed this very easily.  It is quiet and just works.  When I am playing a game or converting a family DVD, the cooler keeps my processor nice and cool.  Well worth the money.  The hardest part nobody mentions, is the routing of the thick hoses.  I am glad I made this purchase and would do it again.
