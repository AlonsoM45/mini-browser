These clip in so smoothly and fit comfortably. They have an awesome ratcheting strap that keeps you in your shoes tight. The grip on the sole is terrific when you have to get off the bike and climb up a muddy hill or something. I would definitely recommend these to a fellow cyclist. Good deal and great performance.
