My little nephew is SO happy with this book! The quality of this book was used so I was worried about the pop-ups being damaged but nope, all still in tact. This series of books is near and dear to my heart and I wanted to start sharing it with my nephew now (who is only 9 months old) but LOVES when someone reads to him. So happy with this item.
