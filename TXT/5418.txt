These were just what I expected! Awesome sturdy, stiffer leather that I know will get better with age and last for years with proper care. These might seem like they run narrow at first, but this is due to the quality of the leather which will give over time. The fit is a bit shallow over the fore-foot and toe. The lack of volume here may make using an additional full insole uncomfortable, however a 3/4 insole works just fine and doesn't cramp the toes. I wear a US 7.5 or an 8 and the Euro 38 was a perfect fit. I reccomend waterproofing with a wax based product like Sno-seal or a similar product made by Dr. Marten. Also, conditioning from time to time will help keep the leather supple. I had been wanting to try a pair of Kickers for years and am glad I finally did!
