This product is a great economical solution for streaming video.  I have used it for Netflix, HBO GO, YouTube, and cast tabs from Chrome.  The only limitations are the age of the device.  Where it is relativley new not all streaming services support it, but I hope to see and expansion in the near furture.  Also, there is no security so anyone on the network can access your chromecast.  This makes it problematic to use on public networks.
