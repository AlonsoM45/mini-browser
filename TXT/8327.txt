One star because I haven't actually seen the book.....it's just that there were 2 things I did NOT know until I read these reviews:  The first is that I did not know that the real, original, ORIGINAL 1611 KJV Bible contained the apocryphal books (I'm a bit tongue-in-cheek here).  I don't believe that any &#34;KJV Only&#34; people read the apocryphal books--why not?  I also did not know that apparently some people believe even the font size and style is inspired.Now maybe someone, perhaps a KJV Only person, can explain what I do with this dilemma:  I have relatives in France, Germany, and Poland.  They and their parents, etc., were all born in Europe.  They all speak 2-3 different languages.  What version should they be reading?  Would the English be superior and why?
