I just finished Sweet Thing and have the biggest smile on my face:) *points finger... Renee Carlino is amazing! She had me with the prologue, I thought " wow, this is different" after you read so many books they sort of start to become obvious and there are so many with the same story line. I loved will, he was a breath of fresh air. My husband walked in on me reading and laughed and said " a good one, huh?"  If you haven't read this, you really should.
