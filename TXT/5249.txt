This is the best tool for diagnosing and correcting light strands that don't work...it is super simple to use.  The manufacturer's website has every video you need to easily repair any burned out strand even on outdoor lighted decor.  It also comes with very detailed instructions in the package.  We used it on our pre-lit tree where we had two problems.  One-one strand wasn't burning at all.  My husband simply used the tool as instructed and traced the wiring to the bulb that was causing the problem.  Voila!  No more burned out strand!  And, two-we had one bulb in another strand that was loose.  Once again, it took less than 5 minutes to find the loose bulb and voila...no more problem.  All I can say is that I wish we had this when we donated a pre-lit tree after hours of trying to repair it.  All our family members have borrowed mine, corrected their problems in minutes, and now I know what to get them for Christmas.  Buy this product...you will not be disappointed!
