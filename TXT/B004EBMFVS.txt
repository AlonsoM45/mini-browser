My last Dreamcast burnt out on me.  I played it on and off for about 7 months, and then one day it just took a crap.  I even took it apart and put it back together.  Nothing happened.  When I saw this Dreamcast, and for a measly $65, quite frankly I was worried it wouldn't work.  Fortunately, not only does the product work great, but it even included a controller.  Since it's the sports edition, it came in black AND with the cords.  Now I got extras.  It was a good bundle, and arrived in a timely manner.  The only downside?  The button is a bit sticky!lol
