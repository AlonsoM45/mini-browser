Okay phone brought it to replace a blackberry! It CANT replace a blackberry! Dumbest replacement ever! Its good for people who dont care to have high end phones. It has email, web, text, phones, picture mail etc... Its okay picture quality is gross -_- seriously no good and messages take a while to send/receive and web is superrrr slow but that cause im used to the blackberry so for others it might not seem so bad. Its okay overall. buy with caution!
