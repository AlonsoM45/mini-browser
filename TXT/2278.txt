So many good suggestions and the book is well organized. Have gotten some excellent skin care advice and feel as if my skin IS looking better. Like the fact that the suggestions don't cost an arm and a leg but really target what is useful. Plus great diet and exercise suggestions! Respect Dr. Oz and am thankful to all the women who worked hard to bring this book about. Thank YOU!
