I used this to clean my tiffany silver jewelries. I dipped the ring in, waited for couple seconds, and take it out. It shines like new!Before I bought it, I saw some reviews mentioning the strong smell of the solution. I agree with the strong odor. However, my jewelry did NOT smell anything after I take it out! So I think it's more important for the jewelries to not have any smell. five stars!
