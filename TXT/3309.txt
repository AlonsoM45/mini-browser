a little cheep and have had to put the binoculars back together a few times, flashlight isnt great but we just use it for pretending games, shadow puppets, and reading books in the dark so it works for us.. everything is basically ok, not good or great just kinda it will do.. it is def more for pretending and playing not so much for actual use of them
