I'm not sure about this book.  I liked it yes, but there were parts of the book that I was like WHAT????  They go from no sex to a sex marathon and then they are having sex while eating breakfast.... I didn't get that part.  Also is the author not from the state's?  I don't mind where she's from but some of the vocabulary was off.  Yes, there is a cliff hanger.Would I recommend this book, yes but I wouldn't until the end of February when the second d one comes out.
