The first book in a series that is far more worth than the money you spend, as well as the time it takes to read. I highly recommend it to any dark fantasy reader. If you're a little squeemish, and can't handle a gory fight scene or two I'd say walk away right now. If you don't mind a little blood and viscera, read it! It's worth the time, and I'm confident you'll buy every other book in the series and not regret it for one second :)
