Let me preface this by saying this is my first set of bib overalls, and possibly my last.If you like the look Uncle Jesse used to sport on The Dukes of Hazzard these are the pants for you.I bought these so I can work without mooning the neighborhood every time I bent over and not for fashion, but I practically look like a clown wearing these.First off the waist sits high, Urkel high! When sizing them keep this in consideration; measure around your gut, not where you normally wear your pants.Secondly the pant legs are so wide I could hide a case of PBR and still have room.Lastly the inseam is longer than advertised.I am keeping them, but next time I'll probably just go with some rainbow suspenders. They would probably look less ridiculous.For the record I ordered 30x30
