I have been adamant about losing at least 40 pounds since the start of the new year. I saw the details for this and thought that it could help me to start losing weight again . My goal was to lose a total of 55 lbs which I've been trying to lose . Before I stopped losing weight I had lost a total of 21 pounds. I hit a plateu of course but am now seeing pound for pound drop. No jitters for me was a plus.
