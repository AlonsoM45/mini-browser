These bulbs are of very high quality, no bad bulbs and the coating is the best ive ever seen. Also, the element itself looks to be red aswell. And the price is great. The only downfall is since they have that extra coating, they're not as bright as other 5watt c7 bulbs.If your not worried about brightness then this is an excellent buy.
