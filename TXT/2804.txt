When I first got it, I loved it! I loved the color, the material, etc. However, I was wearing push-up a bra when I first tried it on. I am quite busty (34DDD), I had got a Large, and it was still way too baggy in the chest! When I tried to wear it with a push-up bra, it went really low and I had cleavage for days. When I didn't wear a push-up bra, it was really baggy. If you have time and money to get it tailored, or if you like extra cleavage, this is definitely the costume for you! It was comfortable and all, it was just hard to constantly be pulling up the front.
