Terrific book, and a very long book!  Reading it on my Kindle I didn't realize how long it was, but I was thrilled to continue reading, and reading this book.  The writing is excellent, and you will be transformed into the ever changing life of the main character.  I loved it, and continue to think about the events that occurred, considering what it all means...  The author is brilliantly gifted, and tremendously knowledgeable about life in contrasting states and circumstances.  It's a read that you will never forget!
