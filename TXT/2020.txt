LOVE this kit. Its literally just as easy to install as the youtube video. Makes your car look like a spaceship at night, especially if you have a convertible like me. The music function is more like a strobe function to me, but I dont use it anyways. Before I got the kit I wondered if you could change it to any color and pause it, and as a matter of fact you CAN! I was very happy with all of the different modes and options and is surprisingly bright. All of my friends LOVE it and want it in their cars too lol. Best $35 I've spent on my car. I think I'll get the wheel well kit next.
