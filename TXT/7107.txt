Legs and iron holder are made from some kind of metal but board is from some kind of cheap plastic and broke after 3 or 4 times use. It was arrived in a great shipment condition. During this two months, I have used it for only a few times and then I found out that something wrong with the board. After I open the fabric cover, I saw that the board is broke. Never fall or hit with something because the leg is very strong. Don't waste your money.
