This unit performed well. No problem leaving it plugged in so far, although I unplug it when I leave the house because of the reviews I read, and indeed it even states in the instructions to unplug when not in use. The toast setting is sensitive, so it may be difficult to get very lightly toasted bread if that is what you like. I like my breads actually TOASTED, so setting it at the lightest it comes out perfect for me. Cleaning crumbs is easy with the pull out tray. All in all, it is more utilitarian than a standard toaster, as it bakes and broils foods as well. Except for the auto off for toasting cycles, there is no timer or auto off for baking or broiling. I just set my microwave timer.
