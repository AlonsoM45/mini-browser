I bought this for my boyfriend. First it arrived late in a cheap box with nothing but a very small plastic brush. It shows on the box that you can use it wet or dry. The first time he used it dry he got small pimples all over his neck and face. The second time he used it wet he got a huge rash on his face. He opened it to clean it out and all the pieces fell out. This is a horrible product and not worth the money I spent. I am so disappointed in this product. I wish I was able to return it and get my money back. I have now learned my lesson on buying these items online. I do not recommend this product to anyone. Very cheap product.
