The case does it all for me. Its one of the best all around cases out there. It functions as a stand that works in every position. You read reviews about the tablets slipping out of the grooves and falling. I have never had that problem with this case. It stands up very sturdy and to a great amount of poking and pressure. It also has a great slim profile that makes it easy to take anywhere. Its an awesome case
