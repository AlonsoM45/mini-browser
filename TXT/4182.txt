I needed a unit to drive a little stapler on my job installing Pool Tables.I looked at the Sears Evolve, the K-Mart somthing and the Harbor Freight something. They were all the exact same machine.My gut was telling me no and then I found this.Its very portable, does a great job and its not to over bearing to take into customers house.I keep it up front of my van between the seats and right beside me.My unit arrived in perfect shape...no missing feet, no busted dials ect.
