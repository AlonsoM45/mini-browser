Laurel is now in senior year at Del Norte High School. Despite all that happened, she tries to live a normal life. But when Tamani enrols as an exchange student at her school, all becomes even more complicated.In my review of Spells, I was starting to dislike Laurel, I don't know if I'm the only one? Things got worse in this book. It's a pity because it's the only negative thing I have to say about the book, this book was a lot about Laurel's relationship with the two men, I didn't mind it and I loved Tamani as always.I can understand that it's hard to choose between two people you have interest in, but she's bringing it to the next level. Poor David and Tamani! And yeah, she's still acting careless even after what happened in Spells and what Jamison told her. She never learns of her previous mistakes I guess.I loved that some chapters were from Tamani's perspective. I think it made me even more in love with him then before. Laurel must choose him, I'm team Tamani even more then before!But the end&#8230; I want to read the last book now! For the first time in the series, there's a real cliffhanger at the end. I love cliffhangers even if they can be frustrating, especially if the book is not out yet. Luckily, this one is. And I will be reading it soon!
