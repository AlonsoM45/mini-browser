I used these to connect extra 50ft cables to the 60ft cables that came with my Zmodo camera system. They work great. I didn't notice any quality loss either. It's better to buy them in packs of 10 like this rather than individually because although I don't need 10 of them, it's much cheaper to buy them like this (I paid just under $4 for these) and if I ever do need more someday I have extra ones.
