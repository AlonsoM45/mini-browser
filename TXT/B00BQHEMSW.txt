I bought this to carry with me because I have to carry an iPad, planner, and a few other miscellaeous things from my office to my client's homes, schools, etc. This works perfect! It is durable and just big enough to carry a lunch box in as well if one likes to eat in at the office. The service was faster than expected as well! I will continue to do business with this company! Thank you!
