First, you were recommended by my best friend for 63 years so that was a good start.  I have received all of my security items and have found them to be sturdy, reliable, and perhaps most important, easy to install.  I had one glitch with my order that was taken care of the same day by a very nice young lady in customer service.  Online ordering of my system from a good choice of products was very easy.  I could track shipment via email that was sent to me and the package arrived in good shape on time.  Not a single item was damaged.  Instructions to set up system are outstandingly easy.  I have already recommended it to several of my other friends.
