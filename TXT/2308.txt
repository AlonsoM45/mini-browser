I was so excited when this book was finally available. I had been reading about it's development and could hardly wait to get my hands on it. It did not disappoint. I could hardly stand to put it down. This book is Spirit lead and Spirit filled.I learned a lot that I did not yet know. Slowly I am getting braver about putting it into practice. Thank Praying Medic for the prayer, time, effort and love into this book. Can't wait for your next one. Katherine Beak
