Its an enjoyable read. I liked the cutaway views and history. Though the Gulf War was pretty much one sided when it came down, I still found it informative on the mindset U.S. tank crews had on the Iraqi armored forces, and was surprised on how little training the Iraqis received, that its no wonder the Coalition won.
