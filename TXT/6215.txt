Once upon a time, I bought a pair of this grey earbuds to use them when I'm outside and at school. When i first used them, I was shocked by the sound it delivered, even when I was outdoor. They have an EXCELLENT isolation from the noise outside. You put them on, press play and you can be in the middle of the traffic.... you WILL HEAR NO CAR. I also use them as ear protection when i'm in the workshop at school cutting wood with VERY loud machines. It protects your ears and also, the sound quality remains excellent.I've compared them with the Beats by Dre buds from a friend. Although the Beats cover very well the whole range of sound, the Skullcandy offer a more intense, powerful bass. It's like comparing the Monster's Studio and the Solo HD Dre headphones.They deserve the place in my heart for the best earbuds ever. However, I know that many people complain about the build quality. They lasted me 8 months... It's still a pretty decent run. They would have probably lasted more, but I borrowed them to some of my friends and they must have damaged the straight cable. One week after they returned them, my Left earbud was dead. My beloved Ink'd were unusable...To honor the best earphones that I had, I cut the Right one and put it on my key-chain. I really loved them.LESSON LEARNED: Never EVER EVER EVER borrow your headphones to anybody. Thrust NO ONE! hahahaLike all the stories that start with "Once upon a time...", this one has a happy ending too. I went to the store I first bought them and found them! It was the last pair, and I had to search for them a little bit, but there were finally mine again! This time is a black pair, that can't wait for the school to start. In my opinion, there are the best pair you can buy for the 20 (the price I here in Italy).Final judgement: THIS EARBUDS ROCKS!!!Cheers!
