At first this was a good purchase I felt but as I continued to use this product (only a few months old) the sound becomes more and more muffled.  You can't really hear any of the sounds at all.  In order to get that muffled sound out you have to turn down the volume very low to where you can't really hear anything.  I am very upset with this product.  I really was hoping that it would work better.
