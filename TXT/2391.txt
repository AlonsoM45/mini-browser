Not sure what was tearing up our yard but i decided to look for a repellant device and decided to go with this one. Electronics are good enough these days, to be inexpensive so I decided to give it 'a go'and bought two. It's pretty easy to use and it takes regular C-size batteries, and it seems to be doing the job! I gave the other one to a neighbor just in case they have the same problem. I used the AC cable and the extension cord but haven't tried the battery yet. Pretty handy!
