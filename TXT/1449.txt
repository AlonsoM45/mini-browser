I brought two bottles of this product 3 weeks ago, one for myself the other for my husband.  We are not what you would consider overweight, but we both wanted to shed a few extra pounds to see a more pronounced definition from our five days a week exercise work outs.  This product really works.  I am a pre diabetic, so not only did I lose 4 pounds, it also lowered my blood sugar.  My husband lost 9 pounds, and at the age of 50 he can once again see his six pack.  I spoke to the customer service rep and she said that they are coming out with a better new and improved product, I will be looking forward to trying that product also, and I hope it works as well as this one.  I will keep a bottle in my cabinet in case the weight starts trying to creep back on.  10 pounds is the max I will allow my body to go over in weight and for a 50 year old woman, this product will help me maintain my 123 pounds for my 5"4 frame.
