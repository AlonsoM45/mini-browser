I absolutely loved this book. The detailed description of how a D/s relationship should the entire submissive training was amazing. The chemistry between Brie and all her Doms had been electrifying. But her instinct calls and she always follows, Sir and Brie's encounters were always a fascinating area. Her inner struggle whom she belongs, the ending, the entire inner monologue was very gripping. Also what I enjoyed was the D/s jokes Lea would always crack up with. I learnt alot about D/s relations and how a Sub is made to act through this book to a very excruciating detail. Love it. Job well done Red Phoenix.
