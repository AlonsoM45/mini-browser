I chose the cucumber melon scent. This product is highly fragranced. The scent is very pleasant. This is also very moisturizing. You really only need to use a little at a time to get the job done. Also, my dog has sensitive skin and this did not break her out. So if your dog needs to smell better or has sensitive skin this is for you!
