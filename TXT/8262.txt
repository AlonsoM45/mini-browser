I spent a lot of time looking for a couple of decent desks for my daughters room. I didnt want the veneer covered fiber board that looks like crap in a year and takes 4 hours to assemble. I also didnt want to spend $500-$700 for a solid wood desk at the local furniture store. Unless you need a hutch or drawers I dont think this can be beat.  Four bolts assemble this and everything lined up, the legs went on in about a minute each, then one screw for the sliding drawer knob, thats it.
