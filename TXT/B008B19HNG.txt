Let me say that I'm a huge Adidas fan.  Have been loyal to them for over 20 years.  Started running last year and have loved all of the Adidas running shoes I bought.  There are some runners at work who love New Balance so I hesitantly decided to try them.  I love them.  They were so comfortable right out of the box that i wore them for hours after I received them.  They fit perfectly.  I'm a size 8.5 in Adidas and same now for New Balance. I def found my new running shoes and will def be buying New Balance again.I just purchased my second pair! I love these shoes!  No more Adidas for me!
