These are the worst shoes I had in my entire life. Really are a piece of scrap. With few hours of use both tips were unsticked. I sticked them but one week later right shoe broke uppers material on the edge strike with the sole. They were unserviceable. Do not waste your money on this, they look beauty but quality is very poor. I will never buy this brand shoes !!!!!!
