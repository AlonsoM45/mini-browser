It works...but for some reason it seems like it&#699;s not quite as &#34;billowy&#34; or as &#34;full&#34; as regular fog juice.  I bought this to try it out, and see the difference.  It&#699;s not bad.  But it&#699;s not great either.  Don&#699;t get me wrong...I&#699;m not unhappy at all.  Just giving my review in comparison to a regular juice. I&#699;m not really sure what the ECO is, I haven&#699;t looked it up yet, but if it&#699;s a good product that&#699;s good for the environment...it&#699;s good for me.  I&#699;m going to research what the ECO part of it is, and then make another review.BUT...I&#699;d buy it again, especially if it&#699;s good for the environment.
