I cannot say enough good about this movie. I had missed it in the Theatre, and was upset. I HIGHLY recommend this stunningly filmed, and family friendly movie. I am so glad i caught it on Starz, and came to Amazon.com to purchase it in Blue ray/3d/dvd 4 pack combo. I would wish that every family would spend a couple hours watching this interesting, beautiful, addictive to watch film. I hope with all my heart they make a follow up to the movie.I am sure many folks that missed it at the theatre, will appreciate it on film in their own home. Our new 3D television makes watching this in 3D, an added bonus. I appreciate the blue ray with commentary too. Draws your attention to what you may have missed the first time around. Makes a wonderful gift to give or receive. HIGHLY Recommend.AAA++++++
