I bought these headphones because of the low price and also because of the fact that they were turtle beach they worked fine the first day I had them I could talk to other players and they could talk to me however the next day I adjusted them and went to put them on and a small piece of plastic holding the left speaker on snapped right now I have it taped on and am using these temporarily until I can purchase a better headset if it wasnt for theFact of how cheaply these were built these would be fantastic the speakers are great and so is the microphone but it is just to flimsy and fragile and break to easily I would reccomend turtle beach x12 or x32 they are much more expensive but the quality is much better
