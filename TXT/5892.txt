no turn based battles, no whiney emo teenagers, and no spiky hair.while most JRPG's are content to simply be set in a fantasy land, yakuza breaks the mold as it is set in modern day japan. Yakuza is a great JRPG that avoids typical JRPG tropes like its the plague, as well as being realistic. set in the red light district of japan (i believe its somewhere in shinjuku or is shinjuku just renamed) called kamurocho, where yakuza reign and the police are corrupt. if you haven't played the first three you should leave this page now and buy them now before you even think about purchasing this game. Yakuza has a lot of content packed in the small town you explore, so much content it may take you several play throughs to experience it all, i have played every yakuza game several time over and i'm STILL finding lots of goodies to enjoy. this is a game that you want to take you time and simply enjoy. the only problem a lot of player will have is the sheer amount of cut scenes, although well done, it can take away from the experience because they tend to drag on for obscene amounts of time. if you thought the amount of cut scenes in MGS4 was ridiculous, this game will put you off. another thing is the fact that each game is set in the exact same place so it can feel a little old after a while, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. the money and time saved on world building is given to create new areas, like the roof tops and underground areas of yakuza 4, as well as new mini games, side quests and new small details added to the environments themselves. but if you can over look the flaws, you will find a great game that has a very rich and gratifying experience, on par with the likes of skyrim, it may not be as long or as deep as skyrim, but it is certainly the JRPG equivalent to the experience that skyrim provides while being decidedly japanese at the same time.
