My husband has been resisting his urologist's recommendation of surgery for over a year because of all the horror stories he had heard about the after effects of surgery.  His problem was a a very enlarged prostate.  The doctor said the medications were not working as each visit showed no reduction in the size of his prostate. He bought a bottle of this and used it for about 3 weeks (along with his prescribed medication) prior to his next urologist visit.  The doctor said that he no longer needs surgery.  Although, the doctor thought it probably had nothing to do with the Life Extensions, we know differently.  He ran out of it and his problems with flow, speed returned almost immediately.  (He had tried other OTC saw palmetto in the past and had no results.)  This has made my husband extremely happy because surgery is no longer in the picture.
