Nancy Grisham encourages the reader to TRUST GOD in ALL of LIFE.  She reminds the reader of who God is and His faithfulness while encouraging us to trust Him with everything.  This is a book that needs to be revisited.  (You can't just read it once.)  It is filled with scripture.  It is practical and personal.  It is inspiring and encouraging.  I recommend this book for anyone who wants to be encouraged to trust the Lord with reckless abandon!
