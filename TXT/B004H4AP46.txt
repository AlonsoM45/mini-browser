I had stray cats crawling under my house and fleas came inside the house. I had to use several different products inside and outside of the house for weeks to finally get them out of the house. Plus I had a neigher block off the entry points with chicken wire. I haven't had a problem since. I also check the crawl space under my house to see if they're squeezing through the blockade. I only used this product in the house, so I'm not sure how well it works alone and I had to use products almost daily for  a few days to break the flea cycle.
