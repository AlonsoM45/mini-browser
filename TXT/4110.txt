These gloves are warm enough and seem pretty wind and water proof so far. The palms seem tough but the backside fabric not so much. Things that should be improved are the that the liners are loose and when you pull your hands out; the liners pull out too making it hard to put the gloves back on without some work readjusting. Also the finger tips have extra fabric on the tips making it really hard to work on anything small; I had to remove them when hanging Christmas light hooks and adjusting the volume on a car stereo can even be tricky. I always wear an XL glove and the XL in this case fits me well.
