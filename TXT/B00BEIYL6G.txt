Steve Jobs is my favorite personality. I was very excited when I found out that there is going to be a movie about him. Of course, I read the book about Steve some time ago before the movie was released. So, after reading the book firstly, the movie didn't make me a big impression. I was absolutely obsessed by the book and compared to this, the movie was just OK. I admit, that Kutcher's acting and directing of the movie is great, but the story itself is missing the thrill which you get from the book. When I was reading the book, sometimes I got the shiver by reading things described in the book (mostly the achievements of Steve). I didn't feel anything similar in the movie.I don't want to say, that the movie is not worth watching. Yes it is. But just one time. If you haven't read the book yet, then I greatly recommend you to watch the movie first and read the book afterward. If you are choosing between the book and the movie - choose book. You will never regret!
