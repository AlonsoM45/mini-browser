I liked this book a lot because it was very exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat just having to know what was going to happen next. Also, it was nice to finally find out why the "crazy vampire" was after Kismet. The only thing I didn't like about it was the fact that Devereux was not in this book as much as he was the others, but it was still great even so! I absolutely can't wait for the next on to come out!!
