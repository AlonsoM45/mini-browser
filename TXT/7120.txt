This is a great story no matter your age.  It it beautifully written and illustrated by a mother and daugnter team, Gabriele Mamone and Dr. Debbie Mamone, a Pediatrician.  It is about all of these fur friends who have met from all around the world and yes, they really do exist.  They have all gotten together, well, buy the book.  You won't be disappointed and you will be able to meet all the characters and see their real pictures in the book!  And if you didn't but the first Once Upon A Rose Princess buy it also, you'll love it. &#9829;
