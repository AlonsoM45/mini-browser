You must treat yourself to a copy of Lewis Crystal's newest book of poetry!"Heritage" is a wonderful collection of the author's fruitful harvests!A "...Go with the flow of the Euphrates" that tells his story.  Crystal is upfront and bonzerly blunt, and quite the hippy reminiscing the people, places and things that permeated his ink! A Jewish kid from Brooklyn who had his heart open, his eyes peeled and his soulful pen ready!  This collection will grab at your heartstrings and your smile muscles all at the same time! I've added this to my library, fer sure!
