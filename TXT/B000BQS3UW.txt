I have purchased an airbrush from harbor freights it was ok while it lasted. I have asked people around and did my own research on certain airbrush products. The ones most airbrush artist use is &#34;iwata&#34; or so I have seen. I am just beginning so I know others have their own perks, but by far this is the best I have held and used and now I am starting off seeing the true difference in my art work. Really like this product
