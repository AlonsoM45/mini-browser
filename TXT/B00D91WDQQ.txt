Wow! I have searched high and low and finally found my printer cartridges at Office Depot-- paid $72 for 5 cartridges.  Depressing!Determined not to pay Office Depot prices again, I found Blake's on Amazon-- WHAT A VALUE. I purchased 10 cartridges for a fraction of what I paid at Office Depot, and they are exactly what I need.  Fast shipping too-- even at Christmas time. Thanks Blake Priting Supply!!
