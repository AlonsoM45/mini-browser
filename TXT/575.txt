I'm 5'10" 174 curvy and I have a big butt and thighs. Brought a small/medium the only problem is my butt hangs out the bottom. I have spanks so it won't be a problem but if you're tall like me and have curves do the bigger size. But if you have a small waist do the small/medium. The material is nice as far as costumes go. Its soft, stretchy material. I also brought the leg avenue crop gloves, very nice and the whip thats in the pic. Love it tho!
