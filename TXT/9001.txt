Fairly good series if you can handle quite a bit of teen drama. I bought this for my brother for his birthday (He's 21... yeah...) But I'm very pleased with the set. Regardless of how I may feel about the series on a good or bad day, the set is well put together and well endowed with extras which is always nice.
