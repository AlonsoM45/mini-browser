After reading the sample of Absorbed I had to find out what the deal was with the overly passive woman Violet and her secretly abusive boyfriend Mick. Everyone loves "life is more fun when he's around" Mick, however, behind closed doors he's a jerk. But when Violet receives a beautiful gift from a secret admirer, things change for everybody. A straightforward and good horror story.
