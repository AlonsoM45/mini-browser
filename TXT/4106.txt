I think the book really had potential for a strong, emotional connection to the characters and their struggles. However, the main character's internal struggle with her sexuality is minimally discussed. In fact, the external conflicts are somewhat skimmed over and never resolved, so it leaves you wondering what happened in the past hour of reading. The ending comes across as if the author merely wanted to meet a page limit- no resolution, no cliff-hanger, just stuck in book limbo. The book as a whole leaves something to be desired.
