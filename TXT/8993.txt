A good horror movie. But not a great Halloween movie. The studio had intended for Michael Myers to remain dead and start a different direction with the series in which each movie had a different plot and villain, it did not work and so they brought Mikey back in the fourth installment. But THIS, Season of The Witch, is what we got from that brief time of insanity. As I said, it's a good '80s horror movie, but a bad Halloween movie.
