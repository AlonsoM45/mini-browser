I was already of this author's opinion, and everything he said just cemented my position. He presents his history, how he came to be in the position he's in, how his life experiences (especially outside of America) have molded his expectations and understanding of value and wealth, and he makes a great case with real examples of how simplification is the best way. You'll be changed permanently by how many of your problems are &#34;first-world&#34; type, nothing more. Well worth the read--our culture could benefit greatly by more exposure to, and influence by, this book.
