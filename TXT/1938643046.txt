Thoroughly enjoyed Diva.  Description of the characters is strong and I began to see them well as the story unfolded.  Author did a good job making it seem that the story might go one way when it, in fact, went another. I enjoyed the way the author inserted the "shadows" theme. This was a fun read that I did not want to put down.  I am looking forward to the next book.
