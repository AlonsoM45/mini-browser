I used this book years ago when teaching graduate courses in educational leadership.  I was impressed by the steps recommended to involve students (adults, too, for that matter) in conflict resolution decision making.  While dated now, it still has value for anyone teaching or tutoring hard-to-reach or jaded high school students and trying to understand where their discontent resides. I sent the book to a person who is tutoring such students now in a charter school setting.
