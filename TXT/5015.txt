I became a fan of Tom Watson in 1977. I was working for the R & A at Turnberry as an Official at The Open Championship. I remember distinctly even to this day, it was about 7.30 pm wednesday evening, it was the last practice day prior to the start the next morning. I was making my way back to the car park most everyone had gone home at that point.I was strolling across the eighth fairway, when I noticed two individuals on the tee to my right, of course it was Tom Watson and caddie Alfie Fyles. Tom had turned up late to practice,I watched him hit a few shots that evening, what a swing,what a ball striker! There was only Jack Nicklaus for me at that time in golf, but what I saw that evening was very special, and still is! I left the course and drove to my friends house and told him I had just seen the winner! So the upshot of all this is I am now the proud owner of Tom's book and DVD. I highly reccomend both of these! Thanks Amazon.
