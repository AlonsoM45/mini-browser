Boxes were shipped from manufacturer, not retailer. They were originally &#34;placed on the wrong truck.&#34; and were three weeks late arriving. When they arrived, there was a huge gash in the box. Only after taking the base out could we see that the gash cracked the back panel. The retailer we ordered through, Moshya, was very unhelpful. We really wanted the piece, so we kept it. We just have to be very careful of what we put under the seat. Blankets and jackets get snagged where the crack is.Otherwise, looks nice. I'd probably rate it higher if ours arrived on time and undamaged.
