The author has chosen to tackle not only an important subject, but an industry that is ripe with Docs who consider themselves just slightly higher than The Almighty. I recommend this book to anyone looking for an alternative to conventional medicine offered as the standard of care. The standard of care is not for everyone, especially those looking to treat the underlying problem and not the symptom. Nicely done Steve Harte!
