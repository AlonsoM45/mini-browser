T.E. Lawrence was a very reserved person, who was virtually forced to take the lead in the Arab revolt, to try and get some sort of sense, from the situation he found himself in.He was able to take advantage of his wide experience, for a young man, in the regional history and culture of the Arabs, to gain entry into their midst, without seeming too English. He had spent several years in Palestine and surrounds, studying the many Crusade Fortresses and general culture.He was also able to get a high level of Authority in the British side of things, through these same first hand and in depth experiences and because he was in the British Army already.Once he was able to get in contact with the Arab side, in the form of Prince Faisal, he had an amazing influence on the whole revolt, instead of only having a passive influence, as an adviser he took the lead and became in fact a very successful General soldier, leading his part of the war effort, by using Gorilla tactics, he was able to discomfort the Turks and force their retreatFinally he was able to take Damascus and if he had been able to unite the various Arab factions, he would have really changed history in the region, to the point that today would still have seen the effects he would have caused, but unfortunately that didn't happen and we are where we are now, because of British interference in Palestine, after the Arab revolt.Lawrence has given us an amazing piece of Literary work, that stands out in our 21st century as a beacon of what mankind can do, if he is working from a clean heart, not just for lucre.Lawrence also was a victim of his own success and fame followed him everywhere he went and with a certainty that he was suffering from Post Traumatic Stress, he had a bad time of itI believe that he could have very easily taken High Public Office after the war finished, had he been recognised properly for his work, but instead he gave us Seven Pillars of Wisdom.
