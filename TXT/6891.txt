So, I'm a mommy with a three year old.  This product is so much better than a purse, that it's almost hard to describe why until you wear it.  Due to the way it's hanging on your body (like a sash or seat belt), it's very "stuck" in place.  You can bend over, pick up your three year old, get them on your hip, and carry the groceries in the other.  All while your purse stays right where it is.  The shocking amount of time you waste messing with and re-positioning your purse becomes apparent, once you don't have to do it anymore.  Since you always have two hands free, the number of tasks you can preform while wearing your purse skyrockets.  Nothing falls out - ever.  Zippers and pockets and magnets and loops and snaps and everything!  :)
