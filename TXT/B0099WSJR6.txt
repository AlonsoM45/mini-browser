This was simply amazing. Although I had some difficulty applying the skin, since it was my first one, the results turned out great. The back is harder to apply than the front, but following their instructions for using low heat with a hair dryer really helped. Shipping was quick, the reply from their Skinomi Awareness Program was received very promptly, and the extra free skin also arrived in only 2-3 days. Perhaps that is because I live near the company's offices, but I am extremely happy with both the product itself and the service. I've only had direct application skins before and those are always a pain to apply to any type of device, with all the mistakes and re-applications. Hopefully, this skin will last me a good amount of time! But one thing I have to say is that the skin seems thicker than most of the ones I've previously used; although that might be because of the wet application for this specific skin as opposed to the skins I used in the past. Overall, 5/5 and I will likely be a loyal customer. :)
