Great mouse for web browsing, not too fond of side scrolling mouse features. Great for most internet and pc gaming, any other general laptop tasks. I have small hands, this works great for me. Only major flaw, after a couple months of use... the scroll wheel becomes loose. Doesnt really affect anything unless you like to rest your finger there (gaming) then it tends to wobble up and down. Great scroll capabilities, dont really need a mousepad for it. Minimal crevices for gunk to get into. Reciever neatly tucks into battery compartment.
