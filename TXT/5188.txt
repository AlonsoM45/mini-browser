I do a spin or RPM class twice a week @ the gym.  It was becoming increasingly more uncomfortable to tolerate the little narrow seats that these bikes are equiped with.  I didn't want to go with a pair of bike shorts as I do other workouts there also.  These liners fit the bill perfectly.  They have enough padding in the right places & are not conspicous under my regular gym shorts.  I've since bought a second pair and will probably own a third before the end of the year just to make it easier to keep them laundered and ready for use.
