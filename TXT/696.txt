Don't water your time and money on this POS. Average lifespan in these heater seem to be 2 weeks to 3 months. I bought two of the 300w for my breeding rack and one has already quit altogether and the other other is about 15 degrees off. I will never buy anything from AquaTop again. Junk products from a junk company.
