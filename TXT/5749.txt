I was shocked because it's smells exactly the same the only difference is the real one is real strong, this one is watered down or something, if you like smelling good plan on taking it with you cause you will need to reapply every couple hours as needed. But overall diesel is for the person who stands out and is looking to get noticed it will turn heads. Just be careful too much might clear the room.
