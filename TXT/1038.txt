So beyond pissed off. I bought this because it was said to be unopened with just the outer plastic ripped off. NOT TRUE! The whole thing was obviously re-shrink wrapped, the box had a piece of tape where it would have had it seeled but that was cut... a lot of the pieces had the color of it falling off the foam pieces. So aggravated and feel like I was lied too. I dont even want to put it together now!
