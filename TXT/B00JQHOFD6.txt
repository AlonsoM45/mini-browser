I write this review one day after learning of the death of Charlie Haden.What a way to go out!This is a brilliant recording.They were done at the same time as their 2010 recording &#34;Jasmine&#34;,but even the alternate takes of two tracks are different and take my breath away.Keith Jarrett's playing has never been better and Mr. Haden's double bass,while subtle at times,never fails to capture the emotions he is trying to express.Their versions of these standards are nothing if not amazingly beautiful.As Mr.Jarrett said in the liner notes to &#34;Jasmine&#34;four years ago-&#34;Call your wife or husband or lover in late at night and sit down and listen&#34;.Buy this recording.You will not be sorry.R.I.P.Charlie.
