Crusher is both strong and sturdy, but slow. Even though, he is "rocking" awesome in the game. His eyes light blue and so does his left side shoulder armor which lights up green on his crystals he has there. Both of his upgrades paths are good too. If you are a "I'll crush you" person, choose his hammer path. But if you are an offence kinda person, you should go with his rock slide path. I hope you liked it. Tell me any comments or other questions you have with Skylanders Giants. :-)
