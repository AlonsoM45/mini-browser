I received this watch as a Christmas gift and have had it for 3 months now. If I had seen it in the store, I probably wouldn't have bought it for myself, but since now I actually have one.. I really like it and I would regret not buying it for myself. It seems very sturdy and it has all the features I like in a watch. It even has a pretty loud and annoying alarm, although I never use it.
