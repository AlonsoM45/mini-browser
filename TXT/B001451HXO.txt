Great crossover series. Great blu ray set (Even if it is just the individual releases in a sleeve). Recommended for fans of Alien especially as the story in these seems to follow the Alien franchise more than Predator. I don't suppose there was much to go on as far as story arc from the Predator movies, although a Schwarzenegger cameo would have been graciously accepted by THIS guy.
