Completely enjoyable.  I found myself laughing out loud in a waiting room while reading these humorous adventures.  Two elderly ladies who sleuth everything in their town.  A small town where mischief rebounds, dead bodies are found wherever they go, and plenty of antics keep these ladies entirely on the go.  Plus, they find themselves continuously helping their inept sheriff, who finds them bothersome.  Highly recommended.
