I wish I have read this book 10 or even 5 years earlier. Principles told in this book is taken from long time ago and they still have a big value on these days. Now I can see exactly why i didn't make or had money at some times in my life, I think you will see too.The Richest Man in Babylon is written in a story telling style, that makes this book very easy to read and very easy to understand. In my mind some principles told shouldn't be taken straight, some of them you should adapt to nowadays. World seems to change, but the rules of money making and having still are the same.I encourage you to read this book, practice principles and I believe your finances will get much much better.
