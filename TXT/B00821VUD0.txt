This package is awesome. The workouts are great you really feel the burn! If your out of shape these workout will kill until you get use to them. I was working out to the &#34;Lean Legs&#34; and I couldn't walk right for 4 days. Its worth it though. One thing about these DVD's, the trainer , I had a hard time not laughing at her. Maybe it just me but she wears the most hideous lip stick and its hard not to laugh at her faces she makes , so I breakdown laughing throughout the workout. But all laughing aside, you get great workouts.
