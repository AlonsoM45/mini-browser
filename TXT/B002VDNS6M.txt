I bought this phone for my father for Christmas it was awful!!!!! The camera didnt work, it was cracked and broken in multiple different places. When we brought it to the apple store they told us someone had replaced the screen, so it was no longer and apple display and they couldn't even replace the phone!!! Can not be used at all and was SUCH a waste of money. And NOW, trying to return it is impossible!Don't east your money. These @ssholes are just going to rip you off. TRUST me!
