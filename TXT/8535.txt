One of the things in life I really value it's my TIME and this movie really wasted it! Of course, the acting is great, because of the talent and skills actors put in this movie. It's their job, so it is obvious that they do their best in whatever movie it might be. Why I didn't like this movie? Because it's nothing new, funny, worth telling others or worth using any lessons from the movie. The story line is very weak and worthless. On the other hand I should admit that directing of the movie is not bad, it's very good. My judgement of this movie is not based on the movie itself. I always like to see something valuable in the movie apart the movie creation itself. There was a time in my life when I was watching a lot of movies and then I decided that it's enough to waste my time watching other people's lives. For me it's not enough just to watch the movie, I want to take something away for myself. And The Family falls to that category of movies, which is well build, but it's just pictures with no lasting value.
