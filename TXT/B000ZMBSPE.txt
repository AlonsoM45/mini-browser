I have a terrible back acne problem for over 10 years, and have pretty much gave up on it because I'm tired of spending 100's even 1000's on stuff that doesn't work or works for only a limited time frame.Idk why i haven't tried this earlier but apparently it works for my back acne. I'm not trough my 5th lbs and 2nd bottle of vinegar, and i apply it almost every day before going to bed unless i'm too tired to go trough process.I mix 2 spoons of clay and add vinegar until i get a paste in a porcelain bowl (mixing it with fingers you are anyways going to apply it).I apply a layer on my back and even though i thought it's not working after two weeks my acne started to clear (i apply it to my face too just for the heck of it even though i have no face acne). After applying wait 20 min and then jump into shower. this part is messy but it's a shower. I applied it over 30 times and had no problems with the drain. don't try to rub it of just stand under a shower and it will come of in 2-5 minutes. i like to take long showers so after 10 more min there is almost no mud left in the shower. maybe people who force large amount of it had problems with drains but if you let water do the work i'm sure you'll be fine (don't forget that i cover my whole back and i'm 6 3' and 180 pounds)Anyways this works and i would recommend it to everyone that has a back acne problem, just be patient and results will come
