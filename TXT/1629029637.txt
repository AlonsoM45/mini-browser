There must be thousands of diet books out there.  In such a crowded landscape its hard to believe that a new book could come out with a new approach and simple, effective ideas.  But this is exactly what Ms. Pires has achieved.  Rachel teaches how to determine the daily caloric intake that will enable anyone to slowly and efficiently lose weight down to their target level.  She provides many great insights on how to accomplish this in both a healthy and effective fashion.  As someone that has struggled with my weight since passing the age of 40, I am very excited to try Ms. Pires' approach.  This method really appeals to my mathematical mind and my palate !
