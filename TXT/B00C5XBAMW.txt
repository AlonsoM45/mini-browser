My 4 year old daughter saw this castle in the store and wanted it so badly. She absolutely loves Sofia. But upon reading these reviews I am extremely disappointed and will not be purchasing this for her. Something made by a brand as big as Mattel and for the amount of money this item costs you'd think that it would be better build. Made with stronger materials. A huge waste of money to anyone who buys this and disappointment to the children that want it or already have it.
