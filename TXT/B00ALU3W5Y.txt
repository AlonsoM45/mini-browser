This poster is a good one but not really what I was looking for. The blue car didnt fit the color scheme of the room and the dark sky gives a gloomy depressed feeling. We are focusing on the "Paris Theme" in my granddaughter's room and want to make it a fun room. She is a pre-teen and didn't care for the public display of affection.
