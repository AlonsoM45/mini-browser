I was given a tube of Rhuli-gel some years ago for poison ivy and it worked great.  I then purchased a tube of Band-Aid anti-itch gel when the drug store told me I could not longer but Rhuli.  I can now no longer find the Band-aid anti-itch gel.  Where can I purchase this product and if I can't, what has taken its place, and it as good?  The Band-aid anti-itch gel is the greatest.Linda Stevens
