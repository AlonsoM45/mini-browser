Got this case for my Straight Talk Samsung Galaxy S2.  The looks alright but around some of the edges the sticker print is peeling right out of the package.  Real fast delivery.  The pen is pretty cool.  The screen protector is nice but they should have reversed the way you put it on because I would think you would want to match up the cut-outs first when you stick it on for the first time.  The top corner of the snap together doesn't stay snapped all the time sometimes it pops apart.  Overall the phone fits in perfect and it will save it from some damage for awhile.  Don't know if the case will stay together though if dropped.  I'm going to order an otterbox right after this review.
