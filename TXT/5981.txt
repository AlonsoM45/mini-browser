I purchased this trilogy for $7.99 but would also have paid more.It's a great bundle of the my favorite GTA games (3, Vice City and San Andreas)!I have a 2012 MacBook Pro and all three games work perfectly fine!It comes in a sealed trilogy DVD-box with all the manuals and poster-sized street maps they used to sell with the original CD boxes.The code is on the backside of the San Andreas manual and registers all three games one at a time.Great deal and works perfectly on my mac!!
