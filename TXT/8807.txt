This jacket is so comfortable that I would love to have a Snuggie made from it.  It is very warm, but also very soft.  The length is perfect ... fingertip length for me so it keeps me warm without being too bulky.  It is cut a little small across the chest, but the arms are long enough which is a perennial issue for me as I am tall.
