Love the storyline and characters, but the ending seemed rushed. Almost like the author suddenly remembered this was supposed to be a novella. I would love to read more about the lives of the town's characters.  Also, the sequence of events seemed backwards in a few places, and  would've liked to have been in on the conversation with her boss when she quit. This book could easily be a full length book if the time was taken to do it. The author definitely has the talent and  imagination.
