It is what it is, which is basically the guts out of a $10 walkman stuffed into a somewhat decent case with a 1/4 inch plug and two 1/8" jacks.Literally all VOX did was tie the 1/4" plug into the playback head circuit with a trim pot to adjust distortion and slap it into a case with their logo on it.Sounds like crap even through cheapy headphones even my Bose headphones can't redeem the sound quality. Drags the tone of my Geddy Lee signature right down into the crapper...and it's pickups are capable of driving headphones without additional amplification! I'd hate to hear how bad this thing sounds with a cheaper bass.You could get the same quality rig by buying a cassette adapter, a 1/8" to 1/4" plug adapter and a cheapy portable cassette player spending on the high side $20...actually no, the DIY cassette rig would sound better.
