I thoroughly enjoyed the "Rear Guard".  Engvyr Gunnarson is a character with depth and personality, and this episode in his life expands the reader's understanding of what shaped him into the leader he became in the first "Rifleman" book.  The complexities of life in his world engage the reader and soon you've begun to think of him as someone you know well.  This is the mark of good writing; you lose yourself in the story and are surprised when you turn that last page and find it's empty...You need this book!!
