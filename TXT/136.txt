Hi Everyone,Well, I ordered this for my bible study group. There are quite a few bible study groups I will be visiting week after week and we need something to hold the bible as we teach but practical without the bulk. Can't wait to see what this one really looks like and works.I like it cause it will go with me where ever I go! Stay tuned...So I recieved this lectern and I was very pleased with the quality and how easy it is to set up. What made me so much more glad is that it can have a display banner attach to it and that thrilled me. I recommend this to any body who need a compact place to set their papers for a bible study or presentation.
