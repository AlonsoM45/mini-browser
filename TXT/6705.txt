We love that this finish is food safe - that's why we selected it to use for our baby's new crib. It seems like everything now has too many unnessessary additives --- if you are looking for something simple this is it! Beautiful finish. We used three coats on maple. It's nice and light in color. Buttery soft to the touch with the maple. There is still a scent to the finish weeks after its been done. But I'm assuming this is safer than most of the crap used to make baby products nowadays. If we make any other wooden items for baby we will definitely us this as a finish for it
