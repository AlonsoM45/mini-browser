When I first got the wallet, I was surprised by how big and spacious it was. I didn't expect nine credit card slots, id slot, and two secret compartments. IT IS AWESOME. Also, when I first laid eyes on it, I thought it would be too bulky and uncomfortable, but it was very soft and light even after I filled ALL THE SLOTS.It's a good wallet, people who are complaining are most likely just negative Nancy's or fags
