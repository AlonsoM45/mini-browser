I bought this for my wife so she can wear it around without fear of losing her wedding ring and she loves it!  It's quite heavy for it's size and to me, that speaks of it's quality.  So far it's proven to be of quality material and craftsmanship, as it's resistant to scratches  and the finish is amazing.  Some people pay several hundred dollars for a simple band like this and I'm not sure why.  You can get this for a fraction of that and still have the quality people associate with the higher price rings.  Don't be afraid to make this purchase if you need a band or just another ring to wear in place of a wedding ring.  It's great quality and for this price, you cannot get anything better.  I would recommend this to anyone.
