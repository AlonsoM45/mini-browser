Chill is a water skylander, which means she can swim in water (unless you can fly over it). Overall, she is very speedy in the game and has a good long range attack throwing a ice spear. Although, her figure is fragile and she dies easily if it is against a bark demon or a arkean sniper. Basic thing is, the spear does everything. If you don't get the spear path, you'd do 14 damage. But if you did, it would do over 20 damage. At first she looked well, bad, but when i found out her catch phrase was "Stay cool" , well that got me. So it might not be that bad if you bought her at least she isn't like drobot. Come one people lightcore is only 12.99 while normal is 9.99. I hope you like my review.
