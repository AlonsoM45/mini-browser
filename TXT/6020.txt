Just for some information, I am 23 years old, 5'1" tall, and started at 132 pounds as my heaviest weight. I was at the borderline BMI of Normal and Overweight, and decided to do something about it. I started dieting and exercising, but only saw small results. :( So I tried adding this garcinia cambogia. I've been using this product for 2 weeks now, and I have lost a total of 8 pounds with my diet and exercise routine!!! :D I've noticed a major difference in my energy and appetite. My clothes even fit so much better than before.I got my mom to try this as well. She's very ANTI-EXERCISE. :)) But she started eating healthier, and she has lost 6 pounds so far. :)Another thing I love is that NatureWise has great customer service! :DI'm also recommending this to my  other relatives and friends! I'll continue to use this product!
