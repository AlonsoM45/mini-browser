The sander works well, feels well and does a great job, but the switch problem almost caused my shop to burn down. I noticed that you really had to make sure that the switch was off or it might turn itself back on even hour later. I wonder if it was from the shop gewtting colder at night. The first time it happened it ruined a knotty alder door, after that I made a point of always unplugging when i when I was done, even if just for a few minutes. The last time I was in my shop I was called away and forgot to unplug. I was away for two weeks and came back to find the sander laying on my hardwood shop floor and a deep groove cut by the sanders edge running until it got hot enough to kick the electrical breaker. It very easily could have caught the shop on fire.Sending back and writing dewalt alert them.
