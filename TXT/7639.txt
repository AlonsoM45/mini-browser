At first I wasn't sure about this book.  I don't really like the past to present, but as I got into it I couldn't put it down.I loved Brad, not Ethan so much.  I just wish Val figured it out sooner.I felt like I was in this story with Val trying to figure herself out.I also loved Clay/Jet.  He was a good guy as well.Nick was quiet but had a good since of humor, Zane was a good guy as well.  But Brad was the best.  This was a really great story.  I loved how Val finally got her happy ending she deserve.  I hope Jade writes a sequel to this with Val and Brad an  there happiness.You won't regret reading this, you may want to punch Val for giving in 1 to many times or kick Ethan for not realizing g what he had with Val.  But in the end  all I  well.
