Clearly,  a retyped knock off brand.  The front cover isn't even consistent with the front cover they show on their page.  After one month of use most of the pages started falling out of the binding.  It also caused me to turn in several incorrect homework assignments, because the section problems didn't align with the section problems in the legitimate 8th edition version.  When I reported this complaint the seller didn't even get back to me.  Don't buy this book from this seller!!!
