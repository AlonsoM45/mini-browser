Absolutly love my brother sewing machine....I am 62 years old and my first sewing machine was a brother.......while I have has other machines throughout my life....I always go back to brother products........i have purchased a Brother Serger after this machine and am still learning what it can do........This company produces sturdy machines that are extremely easy to operate and service......I am not pricing  brother pe770 and looking @ the brother pr650....can't make up my mine how deep I'm going to plunge.....One of the best features of the HC1850 for me is that you can operate the on /off function on the machine without using the foot pedal.....I have problems with my legs and hips and constant use of the foot pedal is painful for me.....I can sew much longer with the switch on the machine....Thanks
