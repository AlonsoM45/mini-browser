we look forward to each episode, and buy them as soon as they come out. Never have to worry about what the content will be, we only have to worry about our 150lb bull mastiff jumping on us because we are laughing so hard. He wants in on the fun...I did have him worried when I was crying from laughing at bumblebees tuna, but I think even the dog found that episode hysterical!
