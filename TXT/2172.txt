John Waters midnight classic looks great on this dvd format. While I wait patiently for the Blu-ray (if they can even make one), I can enjoy some time with the filthiest people alive. The &#34;Shock Value&#34; of Pink Flamingos aside, the kitschy music, sets, and costumes are rolling on the floor funny. But be warned: If you are shocked easily, offended easily, or just down right closed minded, you should pass on this.
