I read this book in one day. The strength and will of this family is truly amazing. Their story is heart wrenching but at the same time their will to keep fighting not only for their two little boys but for others with this horrible disease. I say a prayer everyday for Jason, Justin and their family and they wi always be in my heart X's two.
