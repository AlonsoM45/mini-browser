These are very nice socks for warm weather, they breathe very well and my feet are always dry and cool when i pull them out of the boots, but for cold weather, they dont really work that well due to their design. They have an extra band in the middle of them that makes them fit tightly to the foot, wich means less warm air trapped inside the sock. The side effect of this extra band is that it is very hard for this sock to come off inside your shoe/boot, wich i usually have problems with, especially when running in boots. These have yet to come off. I would recommend these to everyone looking for a good warm weather running/working/general comfort sock.
