Sold and shipped by amazon.I love the way this thing fits! If feels amazing. It is truly fully adjustable with hook-and-loop shoulders and 3 adjusters on each side around the waist. I've worn it practically every day for a month with no accessories(to poor to afford everything I want in one order).I'm a maintenance/facilities management guy and I was tired of running back and forth for things and saw this as a way to fix that(excellent idea, by the way. I think all trades people should have something like this).within a week, stitching began loosening in the molle loops. All I've used it for is a caribiener with keys(35 keys, to be fair). One loop came out completely just before I received my first accessory pouch(Condor). Don't plan on taking this to the battle front. Weekend use for airsoft/paintball/hiking, maybe. I am looking and may spend around 100on something better in near future. (P.S. I thought the hydration bladder pocket was a plate carrier, shhhh, don't tell anyone, it's embarrassing!(Update:05/10/13) I've loaded the vest down with 15 lbs of gear, including my CamelBac and 3 tactical pouches. I've run, jumped and moved heavy items. I haven't yet improved/repaired/reinforced the molle webbing (and it needs it) but it seems to be holding up pretty well. 40 hours a week plus, wearing this, the wide flat shoulder straps are starting to cause slight blunt discomfort in the contact area(no chafing though).I'm still of a mindset that this could NEVER hold up under real combat conditions.
