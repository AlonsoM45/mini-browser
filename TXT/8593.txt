Winslow Homer's famous painting, Snap the Whip, portrays boys playing a game that was popular with kids over 100 years ago. In this book for kids Gatsby the cat has the magical ability to jump into paintings at night. But if he doesn't get back into his own world before dawn, the art will be changed and that's what happens in Snap the Whip. Gatsby tries several times to return into the painting and correct the changes that happened because of his visits, but keeps being delayed by his adventures until it's too late.The author, Barbara Cairns, does a wonderful job of getting kids interested in this famous work of art and young readers from seven to twelve years old will enjoy the book. There's interesting information about the Winslow Homer that can be used in school reports at the end.The illustrations by Eugene Ruble add to the charm and will encourage younger kids to enjoy hearing the story read aloud.I have a feeling Gatsby's Grand Adventures is only the first book about this magical cat.
