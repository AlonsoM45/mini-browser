These are the best boxers ive ever owned. They are very comfy, have no tag to bother you, and also bend very well with the body when stooping, crouching, crawling or any other activity that require extreme bending of the body. They are also well ventilated to help dissipate &#34;Man Heat&#34; and &#34;Man Sweat&#34;. Would recommend them to everyone.
