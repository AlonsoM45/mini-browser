This book is a great eye opener for small to mid- size business owners. The marketing and SEO tips are very up to date and accurate. This information is vital to running a successful business. I learned more about marketing and how to make your page simulated for the customers you want to reel in. Also the process of "Big Fish Results" helps me understand how I can "reel in the catch" instead of just trying an idea and hoping it will work. With this information I've managed to set up better marketing tools that actually work!!!Great work! What a book!
