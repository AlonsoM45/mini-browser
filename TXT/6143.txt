I bought this because I liked the movie better than the first one, even though I think the original is also a great movie. Little Lady actually does good at continuing from the first movie unlike some where some of the details don't make sense between original and sequel. This movie is worth buying just for the parts of Ted Danson pretending to be a minister.
