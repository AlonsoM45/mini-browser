I initially bought the retail airfloss from amazon but it winded up dying on me after 2 weeks so I called sonicare and they said the dental pro model is better and more durable. I got this pro model and I have had it for over 3 months now and it works great. The water shoots out strait and with good force to clean those hard to reach places. Love the Oraltonin rinse as well.
