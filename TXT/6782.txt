I felt like the book started very well, albeit, lacking in some detail, and the writing seemed a little too simplistic and not well thought out. I enjoyed reading it, but I feel like it took a nosedive towards the end. I won't be buying the rest of the books in the series, maybe the next one, to see if the ending is made up for, but since it's free and you have absolutely nothing better to do whatsoever, go for it. See for yourself. Don't recommend it if you have another thing to read, it'd be a waste of time, but if you're still curious, go for it. I'd give it 2 1/2 stars.
