I met someone that was wearing nice cologne.  She told me that this was the kind she was wearing, however, I purchased it and wore it and do not believe that it has the same smell as the cologne she was wearing.  The cologne is nice and was as described, I just do not personally like the scent.  On the upside you only need to use a tiny bit!
