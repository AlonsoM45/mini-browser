I bought this for a guest bedroom so i dont know how it sleeps but it seems very comfortable. It is the third memory foam mattress that we have bought online. I think they are way overpriced in the furniture stores ($1000-$2000 plus) and it is the same exact thing, maybe with a different cover sewn on it.I also bought a mattress protector for this and I would suggest you do the same if you are planning on buying it. The only reason that i didnt give it 5 stars is because the cover is a little loose even after over 48 hours of unboxing.We have a 1 and 2 year old that cosleep and they have since birth, they love the memory foam mattresses, you can get up, or they can roll around without waking the other, thats not going to happen with a conventional mattress.
