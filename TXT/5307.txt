This Star Wars IMPERIAL EMPIRE Logo Embroidered PATCH is amazing. I am in Afghanistan ATM and i have this on my flak. My buddies laughed so hard when i wore it the first day i got it. I attached 3M Fastener TB3571/TB3572 Hook/Loop Black, 1 in (25.4mm) x 10 ft (3.05m) to the back so it would attach to the velcro on the flak.
