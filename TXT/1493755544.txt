Lives can become so intertwined that only years later do you understand the causes and the results of so many people's actions.  The story of Noah and Cooper's love for each other transcends years and brings them full circle.  I am so glad that this is a series that continues to tell about the community of Blackcreek.  Riley Hart is a talented author with such a gift for story telling.  I look forward to reading more from her.
