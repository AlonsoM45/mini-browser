Good trimmer for around $10 or so, the battery that came with it was dead so i put in a good sanyo oneloop rechargeable battery and this thing is good for trimming hair. Ever see the info commercial of similar product for over $20 this beats that way by far. Again Wahl gives you the bang for you buck.
