This is a beautiful case that lives up to its description. It arrived on time and undamaged. The only thing I would caution future customers about is its finish. It's color is listed as &#34;gold,&#34; so there's no misleading advertising, but it is REALLY gold and very shiny. It's a beautiful case though and reminds me of a pocketbook for an evening gown...not a bad idea actually.
