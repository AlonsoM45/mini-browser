Ever wanted a Ferrari? This book will help you get one, later on, it's your choice what to do with it!Robin Sharma shares his advises again. This book is a sequential book to the precursor The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari. I can't say that it's better or worse than the first book, because it's quite different. Different in style, not in the primary meaning. This book is not written in a story style, it's more step by step tutorial  and all advises are distinguished and explained one by one. And because of this style, I believe that this book is very clearly and easy understandable. Stories are important as well and they help us to realize things easier, but after stories it's always a good thing to have a step by step guide, which will remind us the most important lessons.What I liked in this book is that author really emphasizes that money is not a bad thing and it helps you reach your dreams easier. I believe this is very important, because as I mentioned after reading The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari, some people might get an idea that you don't need money in life. And that's not correct. So in this book author explicitly mentions that money is important, just you don't need to make everything only about money.I really encourage you to grab this book, read it and try it! That's very important, because sometimes we have the knowledge, but the only way to benefit from that is to put it in action!Waiting for your thoughts, share your experience while reading this book!
