This item took twice as long to arrive as any other purchase I've ever made from Amazon.  This glove provided little of the warmth I was looking for during my time on the sidelines coaching football.  Ended up having to buy a different Under Armour glove from the local sporting goods store, higher quality cold gear at a cheaper price.  This is the first negative experience I've had, hopefully there won't be any others.
