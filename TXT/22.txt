Sue (Zoo, as her buddy calls her) tells a sometimes upsetting, always heartening story of how she comes to know an elderly man who survived more than a life's worth of hurts, yet maintained his spirit and spark throughout. The story is written in a somewhat disjointed manner, jumping from era/scene to a completely different era/scene, but that matches the story b/c it mirrors how she came to know more about this friend. The information he shared was piecemeal, out of time, snippets that she had to piece together bit by bit. Worth the read for sure.
