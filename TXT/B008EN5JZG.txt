This bracelet is very nice quality. I have many various medical conditions and allergies, I was able to get a charm for them all.  I've shown the bracelet to my doctor and he was very impressed said he wished more people would wear them, makes it easier for emergency medical personnel. My bracelet came with the charms already on it, so somebody had to take the time to put them on which was great.
