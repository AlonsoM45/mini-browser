As far as today's thriller/horror genre goes, I am fed up with watered down PG-13 movies that try to distract us from lack of gore with an overproduced plot and mediocre special effects. And I saw this movie because I'm a fan of Daniel Craig and his beautiful wife Rachel Weisz, and because I was interested to see the movie they met while making. And even though I think the above of the newer thriller/horror genre, I can tell you that is not the case with this movie. Very good movie and well acted and fun to watch. Recommend.
