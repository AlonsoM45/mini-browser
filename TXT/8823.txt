This is a history book written about a very challenging period due to lack of research materials. As such, it is the most pleasantly written style I have ever read. I actually prefer well-researched historical novels for ease of reading, however this was about as close as you can get for enjoyable education. I have now ordered and look forward to reading the second volume.
