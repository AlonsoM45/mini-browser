Such a great series.  I read all 5 books in two weeks, couldn't put them down!! Jaycee does such a great job of getting the reader invested in the characters and gives such intense plot lines that you don't want to stop reading. I fell in love with the Kinncaid family and am so sad that Jock n Katie didn't have 10 boys so the series can continue.  Maybe a story with Brody??????  I am now a huge fan of Jaycee's stories.  I read Hunted as well and it was awesome.  Time for me to go look for another Jaycee Clark book!!!
