I absolutely loved this when I put it on my phone. It was very neat. Looked very nice. Came in handy having a mirror. I live in tn and it was still winter when I got it. However I just got back from sunny florida  and while there I had to take it off my phone because in the bright sun I could not see my phone when on like when in tn. Hope they come up with one that works as well in bright sun.
