I originally purchased four Mr. Beams MB363 wireless LED spotlights with motion sensor and photocell.  Electronic ordering was very simple and that is saying a lot as I am very electronically challenged.  They came as promised and the batteries insertion was easy.  However, I was most pleased with how very easy they are to install anywhere!  Or, you can simply just set them on a flat surface without securing them as I did inside my garage.I then bought 4 more...and 4 more...and 4 more...to make a long story short, I now have 23 of them all over my yard, sheds, patio, around my house and on my greenhouse.I have also purchased 6 of the Under Cabinet Lights, MB852, to put in hard to see closets.  You can also set them on a flat surface to get great illumination when you enter a room or hallway.  They are also very easy to install and I put one on a small table in the living room that points toward the front door at night.  The LED light is so bright it will definitely ruin an intruders night vision for a while.  I highly recommend these lights for price, ordering ease, installation ease, longevity, brightness and you can put them anywhere you want.
