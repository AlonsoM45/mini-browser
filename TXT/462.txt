The mount is good if you account for the play early on. There is a play between the wall bracket extensible rod. I attached the projector to the mount and turned it on to find the best spot to drill a hole on the wall respective to my screen. After drilling the hole and mounting this whole thing i found there is a play as soon as i suspend. Luckily i was able to adjust the screen a bit and a few things on my projector. The circular disc from this three prongs hold the projector is adjustable but the play was beyond belief and even with the provided adjustment it wasnt able to perfectly align. if  you extend the rod the play increases or rather worsens. I would spend a little extra and get a better one.
