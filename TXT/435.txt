I am starting to love Mr. Pettigrew and Mr.Martin.  I really loved all the descriptive phrases and the way Mr. Martin moves Mr. Pettigrew through his very colorful life.  No matter what happens to him, Mr. Pettigrew will find a way to stand tall, a man on conviction.  I love never knowing where Mr. Martin will take us. There is just something about a man who will always do what is right even if it is not in his favor to do so.  This book is very entertaining and has a flavor of how the west really was.  I had a margarita and curled up and went to bed with Mr. Pettigrew. A great Friday night read.
