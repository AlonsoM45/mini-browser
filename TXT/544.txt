I was really frustrated with my old cube.. I had to often lubricate it with Vaseline or some other lubricants like Heavy Duty Silicon.... When I received it I was really amazed to see its smoothness... I thought it must be lubricated with some liquid so its moving fast  and with time it'll again become slower... But I was wrong its still in same condition as it was when I got it....Moves really  fast....Just go for it...!!!
