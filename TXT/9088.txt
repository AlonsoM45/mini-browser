For an excited 2 year old who can't sleep a few weeks before Christmas, I let him open one of his presents early, namely the Cars 2 Lightening McQueen Light, and he LOVES it.  He loves anything Lightening McQueen and gets so excited about the pop up light.He's still holding on to it and will probably fall asleep with it.The toy is as much fun as any toy car for a boy who loves to play with cars, and of his favourite movie character AND a light, it's the trifecta of a great Christmas present and I was thrilled to find it.I gave the car 3 stars for educational but only since I couldn't decide how to rate it, it's fun watching him push the button to get the light and voice sounds and it's about as educational as any toy car can be for a two year old.The toy looks fairly durable, but as with all 2 year olds I'm sure there's a way, for the price though it was worth it watching the present being torn open and it'll last a long while after that.Fast delivery courtesy of the perks of Amazon Prime.  Over all, we're all thrilled with the excitement it's brought as an early Christmas gift.
