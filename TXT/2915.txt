I ordered the download card when I first purchased a Leap Pad 2 for my son. The card was easy to use but you usually do not get as much savings using the download cards as opposed to downloading the apps from the Leap Frog site directly. Once you set up the tablets, you'll receive emails with discount codes. I wait to get a discount on the apps before I buy them. You can save 15% - 30%+ waiting for a sale that normally occurs at least once a month.
