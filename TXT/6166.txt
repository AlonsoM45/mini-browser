I wear these in Maine and often in deep snow, to hike and to take my boys sledding, clamming on the mud flats etc. they were very stiff and a little tight fitting out of the box, but after a few wearings they have proven to be very comfortable and warm. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that despite the cinch top, snow does come into the top of the boots. The top is fabric and snow makes it droop down and eventually gets your socks wet. This is only a problem if you are walking in snow over a foot deep. I solved that problem by wearing them under my pants in deep snow.
