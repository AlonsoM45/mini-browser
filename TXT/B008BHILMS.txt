It came in on time, and was not very expensive. The material fits comfortably, but those are the only good things about this purchase. I ordered a small and got a medium, there are no openings for me to put the buttons through (so the shorts don't button up, practically unwearable). Also, there was no return information to be able to send it back. A total waste of money.
