I have more than 30 headphones ranging from 100-800 dollars including different sennheisers, AKGs, Audio technica, bose and ete. I can say this is the best sounding headphones ever. I even like the sound of it better that HD700.The sound of it without amp is perfect and with amp is even better. The treble and mids are perfect.  The bass is sepctacular. Better than any other headphones. IMO the BASS is better than Beats, Bose and Sonys.Fantastic little cans. Just consider it's portability, shouldn't be called the best headphones???!!! For those who want to compare it with Grado S60i and S80i, those are neven even not close to this and are not very portable.I think this is the best you can get around 100$ and IMO up to 800$.
