I just have to say it again. This cover is beyond awesome. Seriously.Now, the book. Well, it's awesome too. It really really is. I loved everything about it. The story, the characters, ... It's original and fun and exciting and romantic and so much more. I suggest you read it as soon as you can because it absolutely belongs to my best-books-ever list. I love love LOVE it. Can't say it enough. I can't wait for the second book in this series!Thank you D.T. for giving me an ARC copy of this brilliant book. You better not let me wait to long for the second.Short review, but what else do I have to say? If you want to know more about the book, then read it!
