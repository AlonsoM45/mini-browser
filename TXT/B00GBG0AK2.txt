I cant complain because I have worn this every evening since its arrival. However I think I should note that it is not as soft as expected and the color was very very off. I ordered the rust color and it is pictured a very nice dark rusty color. The robe I got was more of a light rust (looked like it had been washed 100 times or more like a primrose. Despite this I really do love and will not return it. The quality is great and I feel I will have it for years to come
