I purchased these to clean my stainless steel drinking straws.  The smallest fits tightly enough to wash the regular drinking straws and the widest ones fit well enough to clean my wide plastic smoothie straws.  They don't feel super sturdy as the metal bends some, but my stainless steel drinking straws are bent and it aids in cleaning around the curve.  I figure they'll last at least a year if not longer if I'm careful and are definitely worth the purchase.
