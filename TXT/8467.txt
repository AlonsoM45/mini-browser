I think it is great.  I do like that it is written in real language.  Not like Anne of Green Gables.  I read so I do not have to watch tv or listen to it.  It is my quiet time.  I get involved and it is nice to read this.  It is easy to follow.  I think most any one that likes a little mystery would like this.
