This has been a really good case for me. The stand works great for me. I havent had any problems with the magnet being to strong, everything has worked great for me. I know there are cheaper cases out there but I'm a firm believer that you get what you pay for. If your willing to invest hundreds in a tablet then you might as well pay a little more for a case that will actually last and protect it. I love it. It has done everything you would need in a case.
