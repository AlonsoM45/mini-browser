I love bats. So in turn I have tried to teach my kids to love them. Most kids love to learn big words. At 2 to 3 yrs old they knew what echo location. I realize this book was meant as an overview but come on, telling someone that a bat sees with their ears and then not to tell them how they do it is just poor story telling.
