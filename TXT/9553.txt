it's another one of these books i just dont get why people keep having to say civilization produced nothing civilization just steals from all these primitive peoples civilization is uncreativeif it is so uncreative then why do these writers keep living in it and producing these books written in western language and printed on civilized machines why not just go live in those places where indians still make their rubber right from the rubber tree and eat their peyoteand dont forget all our modern drugs just come from the indians tooi guess these writers justify themselves staying here in their electricity and gass wramed homes because they can say to themselves that gas and electricity were actaully discovered by the indians and the bushmen and the watusis and whatnotbut of course you wonder why the indians and all gave up all the modern inventions and conveiences that we indulge in but that they of course discovered. it must be because the hallucinations of peyote supply all that they need, their own virtual reality.though of course these writers would just say the indians and whatnot stopped indulging in these conveniences because civilization stole all their lands and possessions. if so, then why are these folks are striving to come up to civilization and get off their drugs and join the rest of us?
