I love this organizer! It is a bit bulky but that doesn't bother me at all. I have mine filled to the max and it is still intact. Like 25oz bottles of shampoo and conditioner, I didn't think it could hold anything that heavy but so far it  is doing just that, there a multiple heavy bottles in this, at least 5. If anything changes I will update my review.
