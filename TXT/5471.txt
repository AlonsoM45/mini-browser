Love this product. Great for in my purse whilst cruising, and using on the port excursions to tidy up, freshen up. Add a little water and you also have a nice towel to freshen up your face, hands, back of neck, and more. Love them. Nice for having on hand in summer, whilst going to theme parks, flea markets, garage sales, camping, boating, etc. MANY many uses. Wonderful idea for all. Stronger than expected. HIGHLY Recommend for all Moms, Dads and Babysitters. Throw into your Glove box, Tool box, Fishing tackle box, purse, etc.
