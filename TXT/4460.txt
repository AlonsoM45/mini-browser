I must say , I wish I could thank the Author myself ! I have had many doubts when it comes to opening a franchise , but this book has really opened my mind to many things. It's so easy, and simple to understand, and it walked me thru the process. As well as helped me step by step with focus on my approach to opening a franchise !
