I purchased this Maxboost hybrid about 2 weeks ago, after spending hours researching other alternatives. After reading multiple reviews about Mophie which indicated that many suppliers are unwittingly selling fake Mophies, as well as reviews indicating that Mophies have a tendency to break pretty easily, I went with the Maxboost. I wanted something easy to use, lightweight, and reliable. What I love about the Maxboost is that you can take the battery off and leave the shell case on your phone. This is easy to do. The shell case fits perfectly. The case is essentially flat on the front of the phone, so if you are looking for &#34;bumpers&#34; to help prevent damage to the glass surface, keep searching. I hate bumpers because they get dirty around the edges and make it hard to get your phone in/out of your pocket. What I love about this charger is it quickly replenishes a depleted iPhone battery. So, rather than plugging my phone into the wall, I just attach the battery and in less than an hour my phone is charged up. I don't carry mine around all the time very often, but when I do it's great because it looks nice and it fits easily in your hands. It does add a bit of weight to the phone but it's not bothersome to me at all. I have not yet synced my phone with the battery attached so I cannot attest to whether that works, but I have no reason not to think so. All the other reviews indicate syncing is not an issue. I also really like that you can buy different color cases. I will say that the red color I bought is about 3 shades lighter than it appears in the pictures - I wanted a deep, dark red and it's more light red, almost orange in color. Other than that, absolutely no complaints and I definitely recommend this product for anyone on the go, on conference calls all the time (like me) or anyone who travels a lot where you need extra battery life.
