This is the best new cd I have bought in a long time. I don't buy new music very often because I rarely hear anything that captures my attention until this band came along. I discovered them by accident on YouTube. These guys are excellent song writers and have amazing vocal harmonies. I think anyone who is Beatles fan will truly appreciate what these guys do. I have no idea why they aren't more famous. I look forward to hearing more from them in the future. My only complaint of the cd is the lyrics aren't in it.
