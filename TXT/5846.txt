The book was all I had hoped for.  I worked in healthcare for twenty nine years, twenty in Medicare billing and nine in Medicaid billing, and in my job I had to read the Medicare bulletins which were many times difficult to understand.  I read the ACA bill three times and was devastated at what I did understand.  Betsy was able to take the bill apart and explain, in layman's terms, what it actually means.  I am giving them to family and friends so they can see what is coming.  The President and the democrats have lied about this bill for a long time but it is now catching up to them.  They won the election with lies and now everyone knows it.  Thanks Betsy for an informative, truthful, easy to comprehend explanation of the &#34;Unaffordable Care Act&#34;.
