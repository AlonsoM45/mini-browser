I bought this when my son was just over a year, after having youtube on repeat forever on Gigglebellies! He loves it and can't get enough. Excellent for kids, colorful, educational and musical!At this price there was not much to think about, i bought volume 1 and 2, and have created CD:S with the songs for the car :)
