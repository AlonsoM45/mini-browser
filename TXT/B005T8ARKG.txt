Bought this Item in June 2013. The first time i used it, it was working pretty good except that i noticed for a fact that the pedometer didnt work at all. THEN i noticed that after 15-20min of using it the machine felt &#34;loose&#34; per say didnt quite gave me a challenge so then i noticed these markings next to the hydrolics and decided to see if that was the cause of the problem and no it didnt fix anything. I tried the machine a couple more times before i actually gave up on it and after a 2 weeks this hook that locks the stepper with the machine broke off which made the machine useless after that. Want my opinion dont buy it save your money for something better. I'm actually going to throw mines away.
