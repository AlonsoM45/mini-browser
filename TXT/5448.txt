a MUST have in snow  country. I have a lot of uses in mind for this nice compact, yet bright for many uses Lantern. I have power outages here in the North East, common in winter time. Will use it in summer for those evening walks, or hang in the Camper. Great for Boaters too. Many uses. Keep one by the front door to take on your walks with the Dog. Or those dreary days, whilst retrieving your mail or newspaper. Many Uses.
