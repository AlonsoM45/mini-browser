So my old wedding ring was sterling silver and i haven't had it but a yr and a half but you would think i had it 30 yrs. So i decided to order this ring because its supposed to be highly durable. I ordered Fri Feb 21 and i got today Mon Feb 24 so not only is it here early but its true to size and its gorgeous i am in love. Im anxious to see if it holds quality after i shower clean etc. I will be getting back for an update. But my ring is just stunning. And a great price i will never buy sterling silver again!
