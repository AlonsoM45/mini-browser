these little monkeys were a hit at my daughters babyshower,  I made them into a centere piece for the tables and each guest was able to take one home.  I placed sand in the bottom of a 4&#34; glass then poured wax on top of the sand and placed the little mokey in the melted wax so he will stay still.  then a accented the glass with a yellow ribbon to go with his banana.  Everyone loved them!
