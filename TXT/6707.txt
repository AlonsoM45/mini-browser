I understand that while pregnant, I'm not supposed to be doing the same things as I had been doing pre-pregnancy.... but.... I'm pretty disappointed in this series.  I purchased these DVDs because I love yoga and have been doing it 2-3 times a week for the last few years.  The yoga DVD was extremely disappointing.  I guess it would be okay for someone who is accustomed to a level 1 beginners yoga, but for those of us who like at least a little bit of a challenge (and to get at least a little sweat on!) this sequence  has nothing to offer.  I also tried the pilates and strength training... not impressed with those, either.  I could see these being good for someone used to a lower level of working out, but for those of us who appreciate even a minimum amount of challenge, this series is not a good fit!!!
