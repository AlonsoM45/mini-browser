I actually bought two from this company.  They arrived on time and was packaged nicely. They fit our Verizon Samsung tab 2 7.0 perfectly.  The picture does no justice.  The feel of the inside is soft an i like how the inside has a velcro  snap to make sure the tablets are in place, they dont just slide in. It has a magnetic like thing that helps keep the flap closed for when your not using it. I dont know how durable they are but for this price i couldn't pass it up.
