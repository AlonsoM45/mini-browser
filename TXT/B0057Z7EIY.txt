I was dying to get the Kindle Fire, had it a short while, then it wouldn't charge. Disappointing I know; So I contacted Amazon, and they said they'd replace it.. however I had to wait a month to get my replacement.. That sucked literally... but I was happy that they were replacing it so I eagerly and not so happily waited for it to arrive which was  around the 1st of January. Then it arrived I was yet again paired with my travel companion! Well 4 months later it won't charge... again So I contact Amazon and they say they'll replace it even though my warranty is inches from expiring. Today I get my 3rd kindle and it has hyper pixels of bright white light shining through the images. So I contacted amazon once again and now are sending me a 4th Kindle !! 4 KINDLES IN 1 YEAR. That's just ridiculous! The only thing amazon can say is sorry nothing else; that they will forward my complaints to their specialized customer service and go from there... I think that means we'll just throw it in a folder with everyone else's complaints; because we are still making money here.  Its really disappointing, that I am on number 4. I am sure Amazons' CEO doesn't care, because they still have good sales. So who cares! Shame on Amazon.... All of my friends have kindles, and they all have had to have them replaced at least once, some of them twice, and the feedback forums are full of unsatisfied customers, Amazons not making it as right as they could be.
