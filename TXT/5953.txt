This is a very nice keyboard, construction is smooth and solid all around, many nice features and highly customizable. Perfect for Strategy and MMO players, but also useful for FPS'ers. The only downfalls is that there is no Blue LED. Instead of Red Green and Blue, theres Red Green and Amber. Also, the spacing of LED's under the keys is a we bit sparse and certain keys are a little brighter than others. Other than that, if your looking for an awesome gaming keyboard that has a great and unique look and feel, this is the one. This board most definitely beats out most $100+ boards.
