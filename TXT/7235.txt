What is this a college textbook?  $80 for a softcover and the pictures are in black and white!  You can't even read a few of the pie charts because they are in black and white and you can't decipher 6 different shades of gray....The content is decent but there isn't anything in there that the million other Lean books don't have, it's just in the context of emergency services and priced 5 times as much.Basically the professor (Dr. Noon) saw an opportunity to partner with an ED physician (Dr. Crane) he had in his MBA class to take the same material that is in every other lean book, put a different context around it then price it like other professors price their text books.
