My mom  and sister started teaching me to cook atAge 11. In turn I started teaching my son's when they were 11. I taught them the same way I learned, a little of this and that. Worked great til it was my youngest son's turn to learn. He can only cook be recipe. It was so frustrating for both of us I stuck to box meals. They are all adults now but I think this book will help him. Everyone should know how to cook for themselves. It not only saves money but when they sit down to eat a good meal they cooked, it gives them a sense of pride and accomplishment..my youngest is now learning and just like her brother's, I enjoy watching her face after the first bite. The smile she gives herself is amazing.
