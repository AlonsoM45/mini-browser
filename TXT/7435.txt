If you can get past the taste, great for you!  It's the consistency of baby powder and goes flying everywhere if you're not careful.  After i purchased this I did some research on Soy products.  I am now soy free and i threw this crap down the toilet, literally.  Soy is not all its cracked up to be.  I would def not purchase this or any other soy product again.
