This is a great book! I gave it this five rating because it gives a very in depth knowledge of the subject. I became aware of homeopathy a couple of years ago. After learning it a practice used by the Royal Family for hundreds of years, After reading excerpts from The Tuscany Express, I decided to also buy a book on this subject at the same time I bought Tuscany; this is the one I chose and I am very pleased with it.
