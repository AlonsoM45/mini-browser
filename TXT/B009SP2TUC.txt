I have never had an issue with screen protectors before, but these are pretty crappy. The first day I had one on my phone, it had scratches all over it. Progressively they got worse and it got to looking really ugly. My second one was impossible to get bubbles out of. I was very disappointed in these and I would suggest you look with another seller
