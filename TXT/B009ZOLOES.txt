Just by looking at the name of the book and the picture on the cover really says something. Creepy and you will want to stuck to this book until the finish. That i  did. What a time that family had..I had a heard time putting this book down just wanted to keep reading. this book is awsome. And i am waiting to read  another book by Jason McLeod. This book is well worth reading.
