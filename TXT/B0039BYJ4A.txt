I use this with my PC for TV using Charter provided cable box &#34;Motorola digital&#34; box not HD. Using blaster on front of cable box IR i can use my windows media player remote only. There is some lag from box but that is normal even with the charter remote to the box. lol  Works great! Windows 7 with Hauppauge tuner.
