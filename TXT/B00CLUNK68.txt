Legendary is a deck building game from Upper Deck Entertainment, which uses Characters from Marvel Comics.  There are over 10 heroes to chose from, with 4 different villainous master minds to chose from, as well 11 villain groups and henchmen, and, thanks to schemes, has a different objective each game.This program is not a mobile version of the Legendary card game, but rather is a tool to make set up a lot faster.  What it does is it takes the available card groups available in the game, and according to the number of players (more players mean more cards in the villain deck), and randomly selects the Master Mind, and the scheme for the game; the number of scheme twist cards, the number of bystanders, the number of Master Strike cards, and which henchmen groups, and which villain groups for the villain deck; and which heroes for the hero deck.My biggest complaint is that I can't select 5 players, which isn't that big of a problem, since we only play with 3 or 4 players.  As expansions are released for Legendary, expect updates to come for this app.
