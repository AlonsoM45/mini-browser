Yikes. So sad that fisher price sold out and had this manufactured in China. Do you think that it's reasonably foreseeable that a baby will chew on this? Yeah, the manufacturer didnt think it was, because the cheaply painted portions of this remote are- wait for it- chipping ! And within 24 hours of giving this to my 9 month old. Have to take it away from her when I'm not on top of her watching her with it since I don't want her ingesting god knows what off of this thing. That being said , she absolutely loves the remote. I wouldn't buy again though.  I try to not buy things manufactured in China, when possible.  This purchase reinforces that decision.
