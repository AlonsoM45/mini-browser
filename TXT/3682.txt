Got these for my nephew to play with as I have introduced him to many 80s cartoons. His favorite being transformers but he seems to like thundercats and interested. This sword extends, makes comments and lights up and has a on and off switch on end to save battery life. The guards flip out with a push of button which makes it cool, so far it has stood up to us sword playing.
