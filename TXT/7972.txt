I just picked up TWO of the 7-1/2 inch scissors.  One for my First Aid kit at home, and one for my personal IFAK kit that goes in my truck, hunting, shooting, camping, etc. My first impression was: Wow...this is BIG.  It's a pretty big size shears.  After reading other reviews, it looks like the smaller set might be a little too small for big hands.  I may order a small set for my personal kit, because this one doesn't quite fit inside. I have to strap it to the outside of my kit.  Overall...I like them. I haven't used them enough yet to LOVE them...but I'm sure if I ever have to use them in an emergency...they'll be awesome.
