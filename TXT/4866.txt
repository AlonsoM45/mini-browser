I was very satisfied with this product. The shipment came on time as expected, and no flaws in the product. I installed them in my 2002 Saturn sl2 (four door). It definitely improved the look of my car and the feel of it as well. It took about an hour to fit.pros-takes little time to look professional-about 45 minutes in my car-looks and feels awesome and fits snugly-leather is durable and stretches into seat-cheap and affordableconsnone really, back were kind of hard to figure out but looked nice afterwardsOverall, if you are looking for a good priced product, these seat covers will not let you down.
