I have received my third copy of HGTV and I love it! It shows makeovers, painting techniques and furniture ideas. I read it from cover to cover the same day that I receive it. I then read it over and over again for anything that I might have missed the first few times. I was getting so tired of the monthly magazines I had been getting for years and this is just such a fresh magazine. Good job people at HGTV.
