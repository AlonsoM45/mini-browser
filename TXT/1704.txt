I mostly read fiction but this book had me coming back for more. I read parts to other family members. Some parts had me in tears and others left me gasping for breath I was laughing so hard. I wholeheartedly recommend this book, especially to other women. It gives you a new perspective on the kind of doctor you want to have caring for you.
