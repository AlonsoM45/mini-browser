The K & N system installation into my 2002 Tundra went very well with only one exception - the hole in the tube for the mass air sensor was not properly placed in relation to the threaded screw holes.  I had to use a half-round rasp to adjust the size of the hole in the tube to allow proper alignment for the screws that hold the mass air sensor in place.  Other than that, the installation went well and the performance is what I expected.  Very satisfied with the system.
