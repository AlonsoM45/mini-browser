We are in a time and a generation that focus' so much on the self. The desire to discover oneself, or to find oneself, or create oneself is advertised all around us. Which leaves us with the question. &#8220;What if people do not like who I truly am?&#8221; we ask ourselves. So we create a someone that we think everyone will like. As soon as that happens, there is no backing out. We must not only pretend to live that life, but we must make the stories more adventurous; describe ourselves as more free. We are left fighting against our own lies.Lomas describe the ways in which we create ourselves or see ourselves:You&#8217;re a mom. A dad. A child of divorce. A business owner or a freelancer. Male, female, black, white. You&#8217;re an introvert, an extrovert, a person who refuses to be labeled as either. You&#8217;re gay, you&#8217;re straight. You&#8217;re a success, a failure, someone who never lived up to others people&#8217;s expectations, or someone no one ever believed in. you control your own destiny or you cannot seem to escape the labels other people give you (Lomas, 27).He continues&#8230;If you don&#8217;t know the truest thing about yourself, you don&#8217;t know yourself. And that matters. What you believe about yourself determines how you live. We were made for something. Something bigger than the little things we seem fated to surround ourselves with (Lomas, 32-33).So then, what is that &#8220;thing?&#8221; I believe, as does Lomas, that Genesis tells us this quite clearly:So God created man in His own image; He created him in the image of God (Genesis 1:27).We don&#8217;t find our identity. Rather, we receive our identity. We are given it by God (Lomas, 69).Lomas wants his readers to know that the voices that tell you that you are not good enough and that you must create something more unique are not the truest thing about you. In fact most are lies created in your head.The fact is that you are a beloved child of God and He sees nothing but Christ&#8217;s perfection in you. This frees you to be who you are with no fear. You do not need to create yourself. The pressure is gone. You can now live free as the beloved. All those voices evaporate as the Father says &#8220;You are a child of mine.&#8221;  He does not need your acting. No. He just wants you as you are. Fasten the &#8220;Belt of truth around every morning.&#8221; The truth that says you are a child of God and everything pales in comparison.Highly highly recommend this book.
