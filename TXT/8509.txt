Atheistic look to the human being. The author, Julien Offray de La Mettrie, explores the theory of human flash and soul being indivisible and basically operating as a machine. Following that, all human behavior and existence is explained on the basis of physics and chemistry.A book written more than 260 years ago. Sincerely, it was one of the most difficult books to read even it's quite short. I can't say that I liked it and can't say that I didn't. It is just a lot different from all the other literature I've been reading so far. Still I'm very glad I read this book. It showed me more how people were thinking and creating different ideas and theories about human existence hundreds of years ago. Actually it is interesting that the author had so much courage to publish such a work back in those days. Nowadays religion is not as strong as it was 260 years ago and the book is very against the dogmas of church.I really like authors thought that the human is what he eats. I think it is a lot true, because what you eat defines how you feel, and how you feel most likely to define how you act what leads to what results you get in life. This entire journey is most likely to show who you are.Do you have any thoughts? Share your opinion!
