I appreciate that the Stamper/Scraper worked very well.  However, I would appreciate it more if the bottom of the stamper was the translucent white that the picture of the product shows.  I got one with a dark, hot pink bottom.  If I were to use pink or a red-related stamping polish with this stamper, it would be hard for me to work with because it would be difficult to see.  Luckily, I used a white stamping polish with this.  It works really well, easy to get the hang of even if you're a beginner like me.  I think the seller should give us the choice to buy pink or white bottom separately, instead of having a picture different from the product.  That's the only reason why I gave this 4 stars.  Don't let this discourage you from getting it, it's still a well-working product.
