Only good for paper, peels off everything else as soon as it dries. If you are looking to paint on anything other than very porous paper do not buy.This is definitely NOT the same as the stuff we had in school. Purchased to use for a temporary window mural, but it peeled as soon as it started drying. It will stick if you apply hairspray to the glass but is transparent and comes off the instant anything touches it and forget applying a second coat or painting anywhere near finished areas such as outlines or a different color as the dry parts will immediately peel off if you so much as look at them the wrong way.If your looking for REAL tempera paint for anything other than porous paper this ain't it. The real stuff has been known to stay put for centuries this stuff comes off darn near everything you put it on almost as soon as it dries.As for overall value with shipping it was almost $50 for the set, a trip to the nearby "Walywurld" and you can get the same paint for maybe $20.
