I bought this for my grandson, age 7 1/2. Not a great reader, he would much prefer to use his Kindle for game playing. However, after a brief chat about the protagonist of this book, he settled down to actually READ it, and was soon engrossed. I read the book prior to gifting it, and found it delightful, fun, engaging and smile-producing, without a touch of sanctimoniousness.
