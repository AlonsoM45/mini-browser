LOve this. I keep everything in one place. I hide the book when i leave the house. Dont keep it near the computer. Wonderful little nicely done book. HIGHLY Recommend for anyone with many passwords, or forgetful like me. My memory is not what it was when i was younger and this is a true asset. Nicely done.
