the product was exactly what i was expecting, you could see and feel the high quality the instant you remove it from the packaging. Although one remark I would have is how it is very easy to dirty which some might see as a good thing as the leather ages and gives the case a different feel.p.s. it fit the iPad 3 perfectly
