This author was very intent, clear and gave some insight for the answers, but to also reflect on at the same time.  I felt he really had the reader in his heart and mind doing his very best to clarify as much as he possibly could in this context.  I would read more by this author because of the dedication that seemed to come across to share his faith and knowledge and to help me as a reader to gain some of those same things.
