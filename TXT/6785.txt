Another amazing series from Dalglish, and more than worth the money I spent on it. The story is easy to follow, and a good one to boot ;) I don't want to look like just some fanboy, but I am. Either way, it's a great series, It's perfectly fine to read as a stand-alone, but it's easier to understand if you have a little bit of Dalglish back-story. Either way, it's as good a place to start as any :)
