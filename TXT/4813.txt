I recently bought this for myself but my daughter Beautiful color I like it but when she saw this she just had to have it so I gave it to her and she was eager to watch Netflix to play games in the music videos At times is a little complicated for her to Navigate but she likes it But I would definitely be buying her an iPad mini Since it's more educational Over all a great buy
