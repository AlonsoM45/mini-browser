This product is by far the most amazing capture card ever made in my opinion.  It is so easy to get started, record, and finalize a clip before saving it into a file.  No hassles or inconveniences, just 100% perfect.  Works great with Mac and I know it works with PC as well.  Records beautiful 1080p HD on my Xbox360 and the program for it is so simple and user friendly, this is truly a gift to the gaming community.
