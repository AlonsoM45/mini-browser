Its easy to install and hopefully will last longer than the three years the first one did.  It seems sometimes my two dogs both want to enter/exit at the same time and that was the cause of failure of separtation of one of the segments.  Nowhere in the instructions does it tell me how to teach my dogs, ladies first to avoid this problem.
