I have read a number of complaints about the packaging flaws on this item, yet I was naive enough to believe the issue was likely to be fixed by now. Buyer beware...that was not the case. Not only was the packaging glue stuck all over a number of disks, most of the disks looked like they had been used as toddler toys. Bran new disks should not look like they have been slid across pavement. Some even have chips in the edges! I didn't have much trouble getting the disks to play at first, but at about season 5 I started having all kinds of trouble. I have had to skip about 10 episodes because they simply will not work in any player of any kind. Of course, by the time I got to that point, it was too late for me to contact a seller with a complaint or do anything about it. I have a hard time believing these disks were bran new when the series was recorded on them. I would have to be a fool to think otherwise.
