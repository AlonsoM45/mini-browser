Ok, so I don't usually write reviews, but this album is worth my time. Unfortunately, this record is something you probably won't find in your local christian bookstore. It seems as if all the good stuff is independent these days.(Of course, this is only my opinion.) Why won't christian radio take notice of some of these incredible artists who only want to glorify God with their talents? Anyway, I have heard several cuts from Lara Landon's most current album, "Overcome." Beautiful voice. I'm glad she has decided to worship her Creator with it. The sound of that album is more contemporary. This album, in which she collaborated with Magellan is completely different. Completely!! And this is a good thing. The album starts out with a completely original take on the hymn "Crown Him With Many Crowns." For lack of a better word, this is fantastic. The beats are incredible, reminding me of 90's techno. The feel remains about the same throughout the duration of the album. And I must add that their version of "Awesome God" is probably my favorite. Don't get me wrong, this is a great worship song. It's just that I've heard so many "lifeless" versions.  There is even a small portion of a song that reminds me of a Pink Floyd song. (My pagan days) As I finish writing this I am listening to "Glow."  I probably won't add too much more. This album is refreshing and I can't wait to listen to it this summer with my windows down. (I'm sure I'll look really cool at 40!!) Anyway, buy this album and support these two gifted artists who only want to share the Gospel through Scripture, hymns, worshipful lyrics and music that will most assuredly make the Heavenly Host shake their wings off!!
