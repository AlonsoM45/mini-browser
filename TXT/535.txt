Look I read this book, I even have it in my personal library... Yes there is a lot of information in this book, but this author is common for cramming important information in a 2 or 3 page chapter. It is poorly explained without nearly enough detail. Not only that this author is from Australia, and the rites and rituals in this book are explained with a different setting of elemental invokations. In the Northern hemisphere it's (East: Air, South: Fire, West: Water, North: Earth) while in the book it's different, and the rituals are so poorly explained I can't see any beginner having an understanding... There's a 2 page chapter on astral projection that is just ridiculous, she gives 1 technique explained in 3 sentences. How would any author expect a reader to understand, or even have success with a book written so poorly? She admits herself that her book of shadows is kept secret, and that is probably a good thing...Beginners this is not a good book to add to your collection. Try " Nocturnal Witchcraft, and Gothic Grimoire, by Konstantinos" "Grimoire for the Green Witch,  by Anne Moura" these books will boost your spiritual and magical growth, and is packed with so much more information that is explained with much detail, and is easily absorbed and put to use. Don't waist your money on books that won't be grasped...
