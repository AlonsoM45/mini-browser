These are a good price and work as three season boots, similar to bogs or muck boots, however the craftsmanship is not as good as the far more expensive brands. I am not sure these will last more than a few seasons as I see a small section of rubber has come unglued to the neoprene after only a few months. It does not affect function yet, but it is probably only a matter of time. For the price I am quite satisfied with these as they have made it through 3 months of a Maine winter.
