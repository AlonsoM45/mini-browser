By sharing this information, I am breaking the first and second rules of Fight Club. I heard somewhere that rules are made to be broken so here goes. It is an amazing book and has instantly become one of my favorites.  One of the most original stories I have ever read. I love how it allows you to dive into the mind of an split personality type and helps you realize that you are not your kindle, your car, or your XBOX. They did an excellent job adapting it into a motion picture so check out the movie if you haven't had the chance. I am Jack's satisfied mind.
