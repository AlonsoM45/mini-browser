Loved this book to the core. Maclaine is amazing  as a true demon/vampire and carrow's characterization is beyond expectation.The little Ruby has added to this book the much needed family love and tenderness. I couldn't put down this book. The ending was truly magnificent it had the punch in the right direction. All the powerful Lore characters from all the books coming under one roof to take down the Order, simply brilliant. Loved every aspect of Maclaine, and Carrow's ferocity. My favorite by far.Great job KC.
