Honestly I have been using the product for two weeks now and I have to say that I have hereditary dark eye circles but yet before I decide to write my review I look myself in the mirror with a bright light like a thousand times so I can give details of my improvement. Well first of all I use the product in all my face and neck, my face appearance looks more bright and my eyes look a little refresh that is why I didn't fill in all the stars bc I am still waiting on a more deep result on my eye area but honestly they look much better than when I wasn't using this product oh another thing I would like to add ladies if you have a minimal dark spot in your face this product helps!!!! Honestly I had dark spot on both side of my upper checks and I don't see it any longer so keep that in mind I guess since is a natural product it works great on skin. Ideally like my queen bee and when it finish I would buy another also ladies when applying this product on your face don't forget the sun screen is very essential :-)
