This case is really perfect for me. It arrived in 3 business days in a cheap &#34;made in china&#34; wrapping, but the case was much higher in quality than its wrapping. It has a nice, smooth feel and there are no flaws in the stitching. All the holes are perfect in size, my headphone jack can still be easily used, I can access the charger through the case, and the camera's lense isn't obscured or anything by the case. I haven't dropped my iPod Touch yet, but I'm much less paranoid about it falling now (before the case arrived, I kept the loop on my hand and sat directly on my carpet, bed, or other soft surface that wouldn't hurt my device if I dropped it). This case keeps it very secure and I can still hold onto it with the iPod's loop.I got my case in red to match my iPod Touch and I recommend buying cases that match the iPod's color, unless you love purple or orange. I really think the seller had the shades made so that they're like a perfect match, baby pink looks about the same color as a pink iPod Touch 5th gen, and so on. The matching colors of the iPod and case look spectacular! Overall, this is a very nice case with a great feel to it and good protection too! I'm very satisfied with my purchase; this case is everything I could really ask for.
