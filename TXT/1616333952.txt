This book would be a pleasure for most young readers, but I think it would be especially appropriate for kids with brothers or sisters. While Mea has magical powers and her older brother, Matthew (from the author's previous book,) doesn't, he and his friend Lily need to stop the mischievous little girl from causing more problems.  Can they stop her, or will she learn on her own to do what's right?
