I ordered this thinking for nearly $8 it was a three pack. It wasn't until after it shipped that I realized I had just paid $8 for ONE screen protector. I just received it and it seems to be pretty good quality, but I wont know until I put it on my girlfriends phone. I only gave it two stars because it was poorly labeled and I have hopes that it will be a good screen protector.
