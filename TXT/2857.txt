Formal dress at a decent price, nothing exciting about it - VERY lightweight. Would be great for an outdoor summer wedding. I am tall so it was a little shorter than I had hoped but for the price you can't be too picky. The color was DEAD on and exactly the shade I needed. In the picture it looks more fitted around the middle than it was, but overall, a nice dress and again, can't complain about the price. It arrived in a soft bag like package, not a box - dress was folded in a loose clear plastic bag inside.
