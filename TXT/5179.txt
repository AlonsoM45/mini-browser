Purchased this for my mini pin.  It's her first bed. She immediately laid down on it and went to sleep, a surprising thing for her to do...she is usually bouncing off the walls.  I knew she really loved it when I saw her dragging it down the hallway to put under my work desk so she could be near me and still have her bed. Too Cute!
