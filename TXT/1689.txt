I have played a lot of mahjong games over the years, this one isn't the worst I have played. The graphics are nice and the fact that I can turn the music and noises off is a big bonus. But the game is glitch. In the middle of play it will stop n boot me. That doesn't endear this version enough to buy the full version. If that gets fixed it will be one to buy.
