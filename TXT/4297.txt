Well, there really isn't much I can say.  I got the game in a timely manner original case and all that, and there's nothing wrong with it.  I think this game deserves a 3 out of 5 because the actual game just kinda sucks. I mean, you figure that for Dreamcast the graphics would be better, and that there would be a more in depth storyline. It simply put falls short of other versions.  Honestly, I miss arcade systems :/
