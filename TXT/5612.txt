This is a great item to accelerate your workout program.  It is light weight and easy to take anywhere.  They come in different colors which represent various levels of resistance.  I purchased the blue, red and purple bands and use them accordingly.  Like another reviewer mentioned, use the door mount on the hinge side of the door only and then close to the hinge itself.  Otherwise, you might get a rude slap (as I did) when the pressure exerted by pulling on the bands expanded the door just enough to let the anchor slip through and hit me on the chest.  Lesson learned.  Never had that problem again and they work wonderfully.  I use mine with the 10 minute upper body workout and they are great.  I highly recommend using this to turn your room into a great upper body exercise space.Weight Loss Platinum Hypnosis Program
