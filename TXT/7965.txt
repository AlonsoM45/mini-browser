You know... you can actually just use a small punch to push out the pins on your Glock, but it wasn&#699;t very expensive, so I bought it.  I like it, because I know which tool to use when I&#699;m cleaning my glock lower and don&#699;t have to figure out which one of my punches to use.  I&#699;d recommend it if you own a Glock and want all the Glock accessories... get it.  It&#699;s not very expensive.
