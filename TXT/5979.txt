GREAT DEAL!It is a Guitar, it comes with extra strings and a pipe (I don't use the pipe) and a bag and a strap and a pick (the pick is strange; pretty big, never saw a pick like that before) for like nothing at all.Of course the guitar is cheap and shouldn't be used for someone trying to make professional music with ultra good sound but for me, since I only play for hobby-reasons, its great.The guitar itself smelled a bit chemical when I opened the package but that was gone after 1 day. The color is good, no trips or something.Ofcourse the bag is NOT protective at all but it's good for preventing the guitar to get dusty and you can carry it around in it if you are careful and don't hit anything. The bag is just one layer of polyester but it does it's job!All the strings were fine when I got the guitar and still are (after 2 weeks). I can really suggest that ANYONE who is looking for a cheap solid guitar to play just for the reason of playing to BUY this guitar!You ain't gonna regret it!
