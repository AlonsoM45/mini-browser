I bought this hoslter for my Gamo p25 blowback pellet pistol. It's made of good heavy duty nylon and stiching. The extra magazine holder is a plus. Would easily serve as a good holster for a firearm. Heavy duty velcro hold it in place on your belt, can't go wrong whether buying for air pistol or real firearm.
