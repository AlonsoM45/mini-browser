This is a helpful book which shows the contrast between the Isa the messiah of Islam and Jesus of Nazareth.  You may be surprised to see the similarities initially, but as the book progresses, you will see that they are two very different people who cannot be reconciled.  One is a man who never died and was not God the Son.  The other is God the Son, who died on the cross for our sins.  These are helpful concepts.
