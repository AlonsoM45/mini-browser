Holds my Harley Road King no problem! Loading my bike in my pickup is easy because you ride up and into the Condor stand and step off the bike. Tying down is so much easier this way with the bike standing straight up! Also in the garage the bike takes up less space in the Condor than on the kickstand. Love it!!!
