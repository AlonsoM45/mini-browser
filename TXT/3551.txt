The case is thin and does not add too much bulk to the phone.  It does not cover the top nor the bottom of the phone.  There is no cover for the glass either.  It does provide a very nice holster.  When the phone is not in the holster, the holster is hardly noticeable. It does offer a kickstand that is not even apparent unless you are looking for it.  I have not used this feature but the design of it is very impressive.
