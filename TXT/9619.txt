This is a great product. The casing has a rubbery finish to it which makes it very nice to the touch and easy to hold onto. The iPhone itself is quite slippery so it really helps reduce the chances of dropping the phone. It also adds bulk which can be a pro or a con depending on your preferences, but because I have large hands I like having the extra bulk to hold onto while typing. Best of all it charges your phone on the go. I can go a whole day with extensive use of the mapquest navigation app and even after a whole days' use with the app (probably around 3 hrs of drive time) along with texting and calling I can come home with my iphone still at around 50% battery life. That's just insane. And on the days when I don't use my phone much I end up coming home and the case is barely at 50% meaning I could probably go another full day without a charge.Have yet to drop the phone (knock on wood) but even in the event of a drop the case looks very sturdy and capable of protecting the phone.
