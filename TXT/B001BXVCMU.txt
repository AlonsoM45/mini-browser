This is one great scope, it's easy to zero, and after about 200 rounds, thru aGamo Silent Cat it's still on the money. The only fault I could find is that the mount that comes with it is too low, I had to remove the front and rear iron sights to get an unobstructed veiw. I'm thinking about ordering the Instapark high scope mount, with peep thru, so I can put the iron sights back on. This was the first time I had heard of the Hammers scopes, but I understand it's a common brand in Europe, especially Germany. I can't say enough good things about this scope, I plan on purchasing a Benjamin NP rifle in the near future, the Centerpoint that comes on it is trash bound, this is the scope that will be mounted on it. You can't go wrong purchasing this scope.
