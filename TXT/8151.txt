Rise of Nations is still my favorite strategy game.  To give a little more detail than the description, Rise of Nations allows the player to take control one of over 20-something different nations and wage war against others through 2,000 years of history spanning several &#34;ages&#34;.  Conquer the world through force, diplomacy, technological advances in campaign mode, or just play quick battles with detailed pre-sets including population limits, starting age, enemy difficulty, dozens of maps, and diplomacy.  Not sure if the online multiplayer is still supported but it's not really necessary to have a great time.  Nevertheless, it's also a fun time.
