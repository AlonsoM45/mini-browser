When I ordered these pouches, I thought they had elastic loops in them to hold the ammo in place. When they came, i was a little disappointed at first,  finding that they did not. My attitude quickly changed and I plan to order several more! I'm not in the military, nor am I in security.  I own a handyman service. These pouches are fine for holding batteries(which is why I purchased them in the first place). I found that they also easily attach to a belt for convenient carrying of small items you need every day! I regularly keep my Leatherman and a flash light in mine. I've also used in as a change dump when I'm paying cash at a drivethrough. I highly recommend these pouches.
