The big barker bed is amazing! You can tell as you open the packaging that the seller really cares about the product. Right out of the box, you can see the quality that goes into the product. I own a 105lb pitbull and he didn't even sag into the mattress!! I bought the large and it was perfect for him. Do not be fooled by cheap knockoffs, this is the Rolls Royce of dog beds!! My dog sleeps on a better bed than me now!!!
