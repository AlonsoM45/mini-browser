The copy I purchased was used but in decent shape.  There are no highlights or underlines in the text.  The seller shipped the book immediately and I was pleasantly surprised to receive my book so quickly.  As for the text itself, I would recommend this textbook to anyone interested in studying floral design.  It is a good &#34;go to&#34; reference for designers so a wise investment!!
