Just received this controller, and hoped for too much. the plastic feels cheap and clacky, and the buttons need firm, hard presses to get response from, specially thebuttons for moving right. i find i might be able to fix this if i open the controller and nudge a few pieces with some extra reinforcements, but for the average consumer, that shouldn't be necessary, and not everyone would have the know-how or the motivation for it.secondly, the driver is an issue as well, as it seems to have a mind of it's own to when it will allow the controller to work. it's a problem, because the pc won't always recognize the driver, or let the controller work, even when i'ts connected. This is only an increasing problem, as there's no alternative to this controller's driver.overall: it works, if you know how to make it work. nothing more, nothing less.
