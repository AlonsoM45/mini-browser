This book is a very positive addition to those on the life of Brainerd.  I found the original diary very difficult to finish.  It seemed like page after page of fasting, prayer, and sickness.  However, this book helps me greatly to put things into a chronological sequence and make the entries much more meaningful.  I would recommend it.Robert D. Patton
