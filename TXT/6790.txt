I have had a hard time reading this book, as well as the one before it. I wouldn't consider my experience &#34;trudging through&#34; the book, but rather, chugging along. I've read the first book of the series, the short story, along with this one, and I believe this is where the experience ends for me. If you're a teen reader under the age of 16 or so I'd recommend this book. It's a decent starting read with almost nothing in the way of complexity. Easy to follow &#34;plot&#34; The If you're at least a semi-serious reader of fantasy novels then don't waste time on this book. It's not that it's not good, it's good, but there's much better books out there to spend your time on. The book just doesn't flow well in my opinion, it has ups, it has downs, and it has bumpy patches that could have been smoothed out. Some parts feel like they could be fleshed out more, and others like they last a little too long with not much to keep the reader interested. If you loved the first book, read this one, if you had reservations after finishing the first, find something else. I hate to give it 3 stars, but the way I rate books, 1 is terrible, 2 is bad, 3 is good, 4 is great, and 5 is for only those few authors whom I feel truly deserve a 5 star review.
