This costume was BASICALLY what you expect looking at it.  However, the belly was extremely baggy, and I'm by no means a twig.  An average adult male needed to stuff it with pillows to fill it out.  Also the snout droops considerably, which also had to be corrected using a nifty contraption that included a paint stirrer and some grocery bags...and sewing.  You get what you pay for with this costume.
