This review will be short and sweet. Very sweet. I loved The Cardigans since I discovered that they were the first band on the moon. As a band, they have released some incredible records,  &#34;Long Gone Before Daylight,&#34; being a favorite. I have always enjoyed Nina Persson's voice. It is truly original and very organic. I will not review each song in and of itself because it isn't necessary. This isn't The Cardigans and it isn't A-Camp. This is Nina Persson! With that being said, this is a fantastic record! Her voice is just as soothing as I remember it to be. You can tell her voice has matured and that is a good thing. It flowers some of the songs with a tinge of graceful raspiness. Just a tinge, mind you. In short, I am very excited about this album. Indeed, I hope it does well for her. Hopefully a hard copy will be easier to find real soon. You WILL NOT regret buying this record, so quit reading this silly review and BUY it already!!!
