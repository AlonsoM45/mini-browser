I dont know if it is supposed to leak all over the place but i kinda of doubt it. writing with it is smooth but not only does ink come out at the point of the pen (the nib) but it comes out on the top of the silver part and then where the nib and black thing connects it leaks there to so when i try to write with it, it gets ink all over my fingers....and hopefully you write semi fast because the longer you hold the nib on the paper ink just pours out. it took me a while to write the review because i thought maybe that i was putting the ink in wrong or squeezing it to hard or something but i've even just put the ink in without squeezing it and the outcome is the same no matter what.
