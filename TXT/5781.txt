The only reason I didn't give a five was because it gave the impression that Hank was only married once. From what I understand he was married a second time and I feel it was an insult to his second wife that she was not included in this movie. I understand it gave a better ending the way it was done, but when watching a so called true to life story, that is what I want it to be; not just another of those Hollywood jerks changing things the way they want. Still I had seen this movie two times before and wanted it in my collection along with Jerry, Elvis, Holly, Richie, Cold miner's daughter and others.
