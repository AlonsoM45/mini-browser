This thing is rock solid and easy to install on a shotgun. Coupled with a Nebo light its a great weapon light for a home defense gun. You dont have to spend big money to get a great weapon light. I have a surefire with a qd mount but the Nebo has more spill and illuminates the inside of my house better than the much more expensive lights. I CRANKED down on this light mount when tightening it and it didnt break, but realize to get it very secure you are going to have to tighten it a lot. Its going to take you a few minutes to install but once its on, its not going anywhere. I am planning on buying another shotgun in 20ga for my wife. I dont know which gun I am buying yet, but i already know which light and mount it will get. This one.
