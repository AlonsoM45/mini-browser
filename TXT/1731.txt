My boyfriend bought this for me as a Christmas present after seeing it on my wishlist and I adore it. The pattern is really cute and it fits my Macbook Pro 13&#34; perfectly. Some people say that it's either too big/too small for their laptops but I also have a transparent case on my Macbook which makes it a tad bigger in size so it fits nice and snugly in this case. As for the smell, to me it smells like a brand new pair of shoes, which I love, so it's not bothersome at all. Even if that scent is bothersome to some, the scent does ware of. Overall, I feel very comfortable putting my laptop in the case and keeping it in an overnight bag or duffel bag. I also have some room to store my charger and a pair of head phones so it's perfect for traveling with all my computer needs.
