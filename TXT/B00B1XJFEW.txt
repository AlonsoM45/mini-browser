this bar is ok.  just received it.  screws were missing, found some comparable but dont trust it at all. my hubby is 6'5" and he bumps his head on it so i have to remove it after every use.  He suggested it would have been great to have brackets that are open at the top so you could slid the bar up and down to remove and install.  What a great idea.  Too bad i did see another bar i was going to buy that was just like that.  Again, bad decision on my part and I'm out 23 bucks
