You need to have done alot of 3d wood puzzles to even begin to handle this. It has no instruction only the number guide and 705 pieces. It took me a month of sanding, fitting, painting, and glueing a little everyday between everyday life. Looks awesome and it is big. Now I have nowhere to display because it's so big but it is the best 3d puzzle i have done. If you love the wood puzzlesand have the time give this a shoot. Worth the $$$$
