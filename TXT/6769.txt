(I am a University of Baltimore student enrolled in the survey ENTR 300 class and this is my recommended reading.)This book started out as a good read however, as the book progressed I began to lose interest. The beginning of the book was highly informative and was very detailed in regards to the challenges and accomplishments between Google and Apple. The book nicely sums up the rise of the technological age, and provided interesting facts regarding the development of the iPhone, iPad, android phones, and tablets. The beginning descriptions were very insightful, dramatic, and well-written. For example, in chapter three, Vogelstein describes an incident where Steve Jobs receives harsh feedback when he reveals his brilliant iPhone plan. Despite the harsh criticism Jobs received on his product, he still pushed forward, and in turn, create a whole new meaning to the word &#8220;technology&#8221;. I was able to take that situation and use it toward my own business.While the first part started off strong, as the book continued, I began to lose interest as the main topics originally stated began to disappear.  A lot of the ending points discussed we confusing and in a since, off topic, making it difficult to draw out the underlying meaning to the book.Overall I think the book was an ok read. While the book defiantly makes some interesting points in regards to starting and owning a successful business, I don&#8217;t believe that the booked help me at all. I say that because my particular business is real-estate, something totally different form technology wars and inventions. I would have benefited more from reading a book that focused on the actual structure and maintenance of a successful running business. I do however, think that other Entrepreneurship students, looking to dominate the technological world can benefit heavily form reading this book.
