This product actually does something as opposed to many I've tried.  Now, I didn't drop 100 pounds in a week or anything miraculous like that, but I do find that I am less hungry than I used to be.  I used to eat due to boredom and a host of other little things.  With this product, I find that sometimes I'm not even hungry when it's mealtime!  This product has at the very least proven itself to be a good start in a weightloss plan.
