I ordered this because I decided to get a gym membership and get back into shape. It fits true to size and the support is incredible. My boobs didn't move an inch when I jumped around. However, I'm returning it and giving it 3 stars because the shape looked terrible on me. It was too wide and flattened my boobs in the center by pushing them out to the sides. I looked embarrassingly wide and flat. I'm very narrow and close-set, and this just didn't work for me at all.
