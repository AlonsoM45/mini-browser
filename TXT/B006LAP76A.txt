This is a great product for such a low price. At first I was a little skeptical about getting it because usually you get what you pay for. I have not ran with this on yet, but it seems to be durable. It it made out of the same/or similar material that those little beer can holders are made of. When I opened the bag, I saw how big this case was and immediately was like "Well that was a waste of money, this is way to big!" I have the Incredible Droid 4G LTE (a smaller touch screen phone compared to others) but because this case is big it fits my phone with its case on perfectly! So this is a great product and allows me to use it without having to take my phone case off! Although when I take my case off of my phone and put it in the arm band case it is obvious the arm band case is to big, but that's fine because I rarely take my normal phone case off anyway. I recommend! Oh and it arrived two days before it said it would!
