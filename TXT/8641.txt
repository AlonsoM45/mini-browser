Bought this 2 months ago and now shopping for a Britax.  Thought the seat was an answer to future needs but WRONG.  Too hard to tighten the straps, difficult to latch and unlatch the crotch strap, straps twist, tether strap doesn't stay tight, not as comfortable for child as reviewed to be.  Have said nothing to her about her new car seat but she(petite 5)has expressed, "I don't like this seat much except for my little treasure places."Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix
