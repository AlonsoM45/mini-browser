The return of Danny is a pleasant surprise. It was so good to find Danny, all grown having lived both the good and bad. The development of the story is fast and engaging. Abra was a delightful addition to kings list of interesting characters. Of course I'm left with the desire for book three. The what has happened to Abra book. They is enough action, mystery, thrills and spooks to keep the constant reader Turing the page. Read it. You won't regret it.
