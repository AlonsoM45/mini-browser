At the start, this game appears to be not much of a challenge. But having played other similar games that start out with easy solutions, I expect that it will become more challenging at the higher stages. What keeps the game enjoyable is the panel of choices the player has for how he might need to use the tools he collects. An unexpected and creative spin on the usual escape the room games.
