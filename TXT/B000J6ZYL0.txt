These champion mesh are so much better than the mesh champion shorts from years ago. They are very roomy and have perfect length to them. Not too long or too baggy. The pockets are good too since they are not bulky and feel like they are making your hips look wider. They hold a good deal of stuff and nothing falls out either. I will be buying more pairs soon I'm sure with diff colors.
