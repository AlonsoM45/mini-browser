i was really excited about this item. It came in the mail, i fueled it up, played with it quite a bit. Loved it. Today, a week after I bought it, it somehow came loose from its lid and fell somewhere . I'm very sad :( . It probably would be better with some kind of latching design so it doesn't get lost easily.  I don't have anything bad to really say about it. It's great. :(
