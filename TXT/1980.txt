I absolutely love this cute case!  Definitely a fan of Rilakkuma and what better way to show that than to have his mug plastered on the back of my iPod?The product itself is a very soft rubber, and it's quite durable.  Not too sure if i can say that for the ears, however, but I always take good care of it.  I use the little black pouch it came with as a screen cleaner just because.I have dropped my iPod in the couple weeks I have owned it, and not a single scratch.  Not even on the case itself.  The impact is completely absorbed in the bouncy case and it still looks amazing afterwards!  The iPod might slip out a little if you're not careful how you're moving it, but otherwise it fits perfectly.If I could get another one JUST TO HAVE I'd get this one again and all its colorful brothers and sisters.  I definitely recommend this!
