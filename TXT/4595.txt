Dead Space 2 is among one of the best games that I have ever played. Dead Space combines horror with TPS and does so without a conflict in my opinion. The Gameplay is fun there are a lot of scares. The graphics for the game are amazing and really well done in my opinion. Other horror games that I have played are FEAR, FEAR 2 PROJECT ORIGIN,FEAR 3, and Dead Space. I would recommend all of these to people who enjoy shooter games both FP and TP but also enjoy horror games as well. Dead Space 3 will be released in February I believe and I hope to see the series continue after Dead Space 3 is released. I also feel the same for the FEAR series as well.
