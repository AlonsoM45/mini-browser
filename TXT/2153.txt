Hi,I ordered this cell phone case to replace the one I had, which was of the same brand name, I accidently dropped my smart phone, and it hit the asphalt paving in a parking lot, but I was so very pleasantly surprised that all that was damaged/broken was the heavy plastic belt clip on the cell phone case, and nothing else, &#34;The Armor Heavy Rubber Case Saved My Cell Phone, Not A Scratch&#34;,  so that is why I am recommending this rugged case, &#34;It Really Does Protect Your Phone&#34;.  I give it a (5* Rating) !JM
