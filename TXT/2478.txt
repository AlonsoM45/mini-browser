I ordered this remote, not knowing if it would work with my Sansui tv, and specifically for the closed captioning ability.  First, it came 2 DAYS early (yay), was a breeze to set up, and the captioning works perfectly.  Very satisfied with this remote!!!  As an added note, this remote has the setup codes for hundreds of TVs and other devices.
