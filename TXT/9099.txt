These wire sepatators work great, I am able to keep my plug wire in  order without the wires coming loose . Saves  alot of time when changing plugs , or  adjusting valves, not having to figure out which wire goes to which plug. Nice part at a great price. They are plastic, not metal, but do the job as intended
