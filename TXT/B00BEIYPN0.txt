Stunning views and huge money thriller. Ben Affleck and Justin Timberlake did a great job. Both characters are very well fitted into the movie. I liked Runner Runner from the start till the end, because it's easy watching movie with a lot of amazing views, luxury things, big dreams, great lifestyle and involving plot. This movie has a little everything, like drama, romance, action, fun, betrayal, crime and thriller. Such movies help me to dream build, because that's why I like them. I believe you won't be disappointed after watching this movie.What can you learn from this movie? It's that everybody has a weakness. Find it and you will own the deal! It's very important in life, because everyday we are making some kind of business or negotiations. Another thing that can be learnt from this movie is to dream big and play big. Of course, the bigger the dream, the bigger the risk, but there is no other way. I'm not talking about gambling or other games. I'm talking about any kind of dreams that you might have.
