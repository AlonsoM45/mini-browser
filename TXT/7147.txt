Very sturdy and easy to use.  The 24&#34; length keeps one from having to twist or bend to get shoes on; &#34;handle&#34; on top makes it easy to remove from shoe.  My husband was heartbroken when we could not find one of these locally (so we bought two) to replace the one we had that was broken in a household move.
