I love it when an author can bring you into their made up world and make you feel like a friend, confidant, or family. Having a special child of my own I could relate to the teacher and her madcap class. I've also spent time in similar classrooms and enjoyed the uniqueness of each and every child. Her story drew me into their world and had me laughing so hard my family thought I had lost my mind, so I shared the passage so they could laugh with me. Read this book if you enjoy a book with strong women, you won't regret it.
