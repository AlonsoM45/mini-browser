Right out of the box I could tell I would like this product. I came from a Logitech M100, a standard computer mouse with 1000 dpi. Right after I plugged it into the computer, the mouse flew across the screen and I was amazed. I now run at about 3300 dpi.Pro:More dpi than I would ever needSoftware is very nice. Alot of ways to program your mouseCan turn of LEDs if you want (Can also auto turn off when the screen shuts off)Amazing feel for palm gripCons:Packaging had almost no wear, but there was just a tad. Not a big deal, it's hardly noticeable and doesn&#8217;t effect the mouse at all.
