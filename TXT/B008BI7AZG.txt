I got this watch box obviously because it was cheaper, and it still had great reviews!Pros:-Sturdy-Fits my 47mm watch-Very nice lookingCons:-It looks really nice, the top is not glass like it says but it is a nice plastic that looks like glass.-My box did not come with a lock and key, which I did not expect, but I really wasn't going to use it anyways.
