I regret I bought this laptop. So may things work wrong. Wifi disconnects so often than sometimes I have to connect it few times an hour. Touchpod doesn't work well as well, usualy have to press few times to open what I want. My old HP was much better.What is funny, just after opening Vaio for the first time, I got the notification that I already have 333 errors in the computer which make the computer work slow and if I wanna fix it, I have to buy special program. Are they normal? I spent more than a 1000$ for that piece of crap and they do that to a new laptop? No way. It's slow, so many times it's just suspended and websites don't respond. Few times Windows was completely not working, even restart didn't work. Maybe I just had a bad luck with Vaio, but I WON&#34;T recommend it to anybody, Invest your money somewhere else.
