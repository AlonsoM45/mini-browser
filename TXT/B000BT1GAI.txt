Excellent, EXCELLENT knife! Very lightweight with the FRN scales, which is NOT cheap plastic as some have said. The swede grind is perfection, coming sharp as hell right out of the box. I would not hesitate to buy this knife again! Fits in the pocket nicely and can barely tell it's there. Doesn't rip your pants either when you pull it out as some G10 handles have the tendency to do(I still like G10 btw) Another solid product from Spyderco.
