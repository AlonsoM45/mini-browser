The dress color came in darker than the image showed.  I was expecting a pale pink, more of a blush color, but it is more of a light tan color.  The length is too long for me, I'm 5' 2' with a little heal,  so I will have to take it to get hemmed.  Over all it is still a nice dress and I am going to keep it.
