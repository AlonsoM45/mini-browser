Got this for my 3 year old son and my 5 year old nephew. It was on sale for 4.50!!! I love them. They were very easy to use perfect size for them and really got there attention! This was my first volcano kit too and I was really into it!!! Its so much fun! Great price and definitely recommend even for older kids Im in my mid twenties and I couldn't wait to use it! Its great for all ages Its not very tall which is sensible since you cant keep them anyway. It was really easy to use and paint! You will need your own vinegar and baking soda and food coloring if you prefer that I just added the red paint into the vinegar for ours. Anyways excellent purchase I recommend this to everyone!!!!!
