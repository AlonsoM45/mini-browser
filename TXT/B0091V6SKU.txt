This album really gets at the heart of what Christmas is about- the good news that God came to redeem us. There are certainly traditional elements in the album, but there are a refreshing amount of upbeat, wonderful new melodies, as well. This is a must-have album for someone looking for &#34;new&#34; Christmas music, or Christmas music done in a new way.
