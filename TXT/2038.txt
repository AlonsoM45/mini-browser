This case totally lives up to the hype. It fits perfectly of course, and the display works great. There wasn't any interference with answering calls through the display.The only concern is that the back is left unprotected. I loved that the front display is protected if I accidentally drop the phone, but I am concerned about the back and corners. I love the features so I'm not going to switch it out. As a terrorist fix, I used a cheap eBay back protector on it until my flip mate case from spigen comes in. Until then I'm baby-ing my device.SPIGEN SGP Samsung Galaxy S4 Case Flip [Flip Mate] [Crystal Clear] S-View Cover Protector / Samsung Flip Cover Back Protector for Galaxy S IV Galaxy SIV i9500
