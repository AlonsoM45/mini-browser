I got this sprayer with my Duracoat shake n spray kit, and while at first I was a little hesitant about spraying the slide of my glock 34 with this...I am very pleased with the results. I also duracoated my Blackhawk holster, kydex knife sheath, knife handle, 2 AR-15 magpul magazines, my forward grip, AR buttstock and grip.  And I still have a little propellant left over in the canister.  This is just to show you how much I was able to do with just ONE can.As far as spray... YES, an airbrush would have a finer finish. But the finish on this was good.  Actually REALLY good.  My glock slide isn&#699;t completely smooth, and has a fine texture to it.  At first I wasn&#699;t sure about it...BUT, once I put my gun back together and racked the slide, I realized something...NO FINGER PRINTS on my slide!!!!  I&#699;m ALWAYS wiping down my slide because my friends gun has prints on it that are just STUCK now. So I&#699;m constantly worried about that.  But this finish gives my slide an ever so light texture.  And I like that alot.  On my AR polymer stock and grip it came out smooth.  LIke factory smooth.  I&#699;m sure it&#699;s because it&#699;s the polymer.  But it looks really good.  The kydex to it very well also.  l was very pleased with the results.I rated it 4 stars because I like it and I would love it if it were a little bigger, and came with smaller jars.  That way I could clean out the sprayer, and attach different color jars quickly.  Also, because it&#699;s a canned product, you need to be careful to shoot some out after setting it down for a few minutes to prime the paint thru the system.  But it works, and works well enough that I just bought two more of these power units to paint other gun parts.Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to use duracoat or any other coating application.
