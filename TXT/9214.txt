This is a very good moisturizer for dry cuticles in the winter.  I am very pleased with the results of using it everyday for three weeks.  It is so soothing after doing the dishes in bleach water. My cuticles look and feel much nicer.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants healthy looking cuticles.
