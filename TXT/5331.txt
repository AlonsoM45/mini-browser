I had the privilege of working with Roger in person as he was developing this book, and I can personally attest to its impact. Through the simple lessons learned through this text, I was able to gain control of my ulcerative colitis for the first time in seventeen years; I was also able to gain muscle tone, lose fat, and start an exercise program for the first time in my life. Roger's clear, insightful, logical, sustainable, and kind approach to explaining WHY certain dietary changes are necessary makes all the difference. There is no yelling, lecturing, jargon, or hype - Roger's writing is engaging, clear, and taps in to both your common sense and the heart of what is holding you back on your path to better health. As a lifelong exercise-phobe, and someone who is skeptical about &#34;fad&#34; diets, I found Roger's approach to both movement and eating to make it easy and feasible to make changes that I believed in, without having to force myself to believe in things I didn't. I have shared this e-book with my friends and family already, and I really suggest it to anyone who is looking to make a profound shift in their health.
