I know they're cheap, but don't let amazon get away with false advertising. Compare the ones you receive with the set in the picture. NOT THE SAME. I don't know who could possibly give these false advertised chisels a good review. Anyone who knows anything about woodworking would know that these are Chinese garbage not worthy of a doorstop. Granted these are not premium chisels, but the ones pictured are good mid-level chisels. I don't know if anyone else is, but I am SO SICK of the false advertising on this website. The chisels shown in the picture are the Irwins that were still made in Sheffield England (originally Marples which was great quality), it even says it on the chisel in the picture. Irwin has outsourced their work to China unfortunately, but somehow Amazon is still allowed to show a picture of quality English made chisels and then send you the garbage made in China that have different handles, blade metal, and overall quality. THIS IS INSANE. Needless to say I sent the chisels back for a refund. Amazon gets an F for its report card today.
