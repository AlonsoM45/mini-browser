So here's a REAL  REVIEW. This app does work, there are alot of people complaining about a good app.The Good:  So basically they've got Over a Dozen of there popular shows like Scandal, neighbors, Once. Plus several News programs, both Today shows, 20/20, what would U do &amp; More. For a total of 25 or 30 different programs, maybe more. There are the latest 5 episodes of each able to use watched.The shows clarity depends on your internet speed and your tablet or computer. So the people complaining about it are just cheap. It will stream as good as Netflix or YouTube.Commercials:  Yes you have to watch them but there is one at the beginning of the show and Maybe 2or3 throughout.  You pay $30-100 for cable and have to watch several commercials every 7 mins. This is FREE and there are like 20 less commercials to watch per show. When I was watching nightline there was only one at the beginning.THE  BAD:  I've watched five shows with no problem but one time it did freeze on me. Another time there was a short delay at the very first show I watched there was a 15 or 20 second delay before it startedMY CONCLUSION:  Great Free App , I would pay for it knowing it's this good. I would highly recommend getting. I have a kindle fire HD 7&quot;  I can't guarantee it works with all devices but it sure is worth a shot.  I have gotten other &quot;so-called&quot; tv apps and they didn't let you watch anything. This is different,  download it and you will be happy you did. Then like my comment for giving you such a great suggestion
