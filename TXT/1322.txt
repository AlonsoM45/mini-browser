This book is one of my least favorites in this series so far. I love that it continues to fallow the other couples as there stories continue to unfold, however I felt as though this book was to short. There is getting to be detail after detail in the story lines of the numerous couples that needs to be told, i felt as tho grit and his masters story didn't get the details it deserves. I am not sure if that was due to moving things along or trying to shorten thing so the book didn't get to long ? I personal would have preferred the extra pages and details. I was just getting into grit and his master's story when this book came to an end, I am ready for stix to release to see what happens next!
