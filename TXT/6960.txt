Purchased from Best Service Stores. Arrived in time. This doesn't have high demand in the area of packaging, so I'd say it was adequately packed. Have it in use on my NcSTAR hydration vest(which is, itself, unimpressive) equipped with MOLLE webbing. It holds my carabiner of keys nicely.  Easy to access.
