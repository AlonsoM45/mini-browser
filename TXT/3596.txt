I have read the major books by Don Richardson, and appreciate his ministry and message.  He emphasizes the possibility of a cultural equivalent to present the gospel, and thanks to his emphasis, I was able to find one during my time in Suriname.  However, as opposed to Ee Tauw!, he presents the people as they are in the raw, which makes it difficult to show in mixed audience with so many bare breasted women.  I realize that this is reality, but makes it difficult for me to use the film.
