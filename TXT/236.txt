I discovered the first book as a recommendation from amazon list..tried the sample and I've devoured them all in 3 days!! I can not wait for the next one! I'm a huge Ilona Andrews, nalini Singh, Patricia Briggs fan and I actually put on hold my new nalini for your stories I was fascinated by the world u created and the character depth and detail is wonderful. Even secondary characters have great back stories and I hope to learn more about them all. Excellent writing and transitioning a few editing mistakes thru out the books but u hooked me into the story so deep I didn't care and believe me when I say I almost NEVER get over those things... I don't want to be bogged down by my own version of auto correct in my mind thru the stories to miss the fun of reading one so thank you for being as diligent as u were and I'll be back in sept for the new one!!
