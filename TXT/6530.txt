this fan is sturdy, holds my computer at the proper angle and the blue lights are cool too... its a shame it had to break so soon. within the first week of receiving it one of the three fans quit, but i continued to use it with only two fans remaining. however within four months it was completely broken and nothing but a cheap plastic computer stand. if you are looking for something functional i suggest you spend only a few dollars more as this is too cheap to last for any reasonable amount of time.
