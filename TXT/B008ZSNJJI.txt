Sweater runs smaller than sizing chart advises. I am a size 14/16 and i would have bought an XL based on the sizing chart. However, they were out of that size, so I ordered a 2XL, thinking it would be kind of nice to have a roomier fit, since I planned to wear this over leggings. Not so much. The 2XL is VERY tight, although that sizing is suppose to fit an 18/20.
