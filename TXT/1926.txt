Is it a yeti or an ice man? No its the fierce yeti of the water element, Slam Bam. Despite not being a giant, Slam Bam is one power house with his four arms. He'll devastate anything in his way. This is one must have skylander in your collection. His upgrades paths; his brawler fighter path, and his ice prison path. Both are very good but when you get to his soul gem, you need to find it in Empire of Ice which in this single character pack, does not come with. So you have to buy another Slam Bam with his adventure pack. Overall, you would still be pleased with him throughout the game. I hoped you liked my review.
