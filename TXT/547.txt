One of the screws of the mounting stand was broken. The gooseneck is too hard to bend.  I would not like it even if it was not broken as its too hard to adjust or bend the gooseneck.Go for it if you want a sturdy stand. But if you are looking for something which is soft to bend then this might disappoint you.Hope this helps you to make a decision.Thanks,kk
