I purchased this Samsung Galaxy Proclaim because of all the good reviews.  Everyone said that it worked well on Straight Talk even though it has Net10.  I just called Straight Talk and was told they could not activate this phone without a sim card!!  I have purchased a Straight Talk $45.00 - 30 day service card at Walmart and a $150.00 phone that I can not use.  DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS??
