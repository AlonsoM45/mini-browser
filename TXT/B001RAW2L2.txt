I love this product! Yes the sizes are strange but if you can find a size that fits its great to use. I started using one on my redbone coonhound and it worked perfectly and he liked it better because it didn't have the strap over his muzzle. So when my boston terrier started getting a luxating patella her pulling all the time didn't help. I didn't want to use the normal gentle leader on her because bostons tend to have eye problems and the strap would cause more pressure on her eyes. Today I received her harness and its such a joy to walk her now. she's only 20lb but all muscle with the harness she is no longer dragging me around. This product is worth every penny.
