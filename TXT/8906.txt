I was looking for cal king burgundy sheets, basically a rich merlot color to match the rest of my bedroom. I am also a sheet snob a prefer cotton sheets with a high thread count.These looked ideal, then they arrived. The color is the exact same color as a raspberry or a dark pink - far from what I was looking for or expecting from the photo. They are not burgundy. One of the pillow cases had a hole the size of a silver dollar in the seam, the texture is okay at best. We used the sheets for a few weeks, I wash my bedding every week, and noticed the spots where my husband and I lay the fitted sheet started to turn white and wore very quickly and very poorly. I threw them out, giant waste of money.
