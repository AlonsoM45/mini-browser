DO NOT BUY!!!!!! From the get go the unit was horrible. The exhaust fan hose fell out of the window housing, the unit filled with water within one day, leaked all over the hardwood floors and warped them. And the unit has a light that is supposed to warn you when the unit is full of water, did not come on. The air blows sideways out of the unit with no way to fix it. It now constantly drips water even when it is not turned on. I also heard they do not make replacement parts for this unit anymore. STAY AWAY!!!!
