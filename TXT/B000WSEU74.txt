I was researching MSM pills for my hair, but stumbled across info about the cream for skin. After reading the reviews, I ordered a jar. I am now on my 3rd jar and LOVING IT! I was the queen of acne/oil face crap, and now only use this!! My prescription face cream can't even compare to this!! I have my sister and mom both using it now. I had super oily and acne prone skin, and now since using this after washing my face, it has disappeared! I hope they never stop making this stuff!
