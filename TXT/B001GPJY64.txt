It wasn't stiff at all the first few rolls which is a problem with a lot of rollers. The paper fits absolutely perfectly, and it rolls my cigarettes to the perfect size (as thick as store-bought cigs, not thin like Misty's). It's very sturdy, and I've had no problems since my purchase. This is the roller to get my friend!
