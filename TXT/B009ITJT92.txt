I&#699;ve used this multiple times on my smoker, as well as my grill.  Hasn&#699;t failed me yet.  Did a tri-tip with it to perfection on my grill.  I cannot tell exactly how accurate it is, but it&#699;s close enought to my needs.  I like the ability to use both probes, and I also like how it will tell you if the temp in my smoker drops below 220 or if it gets too hot.  For the price...it&#699;s well worth it.I&#699;ve seen reviews saying how its inaccurate or it gives weird readings... mine hasn&#699;t yet. It could be just a bad unit.  But since this was sold and shipped by Amazon, I had no worries about being able to return it for a replacement.  So...make sure it&#699;s being sold and shipped by Amazon..and buy with confidence!
