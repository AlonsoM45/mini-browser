One of 2 my favorite movies. One of movies' classics masterpieces! I can still remember watching this movie almost 20 years ago, when it appeared on a big screens. Since then I watched Braveheart more than 10 times and every time watching I still get the same feeling as it was the first time. What made me such a huge impression? The simple answer would be - everything. The movie is really done brilliantly. Having in mind that it is almost 20 years old and it's impossible to compare it to today movies, but still this movie can compete with majority of the movies being made today. My second favorite movie is Avatar and I can say that Braveheart is the Avatar in those days.The story line is quite simple, but the implementation of it is astonishing. Mel Gibson did a great job combining all the components together to make Braveheart. The movie has everything: romance, freedom, fight, betrayal, love, will, persistence, idea, legacy and many more elements of life. It's impossible to describe this movie in any review. The only way to understand it is to watch it yourself. I believe, that there won't be anybody left with no feeling after this movie!
