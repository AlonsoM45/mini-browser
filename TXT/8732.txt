I have used Pinnacle for years and found it very user friendly.  Now they come out with Studio 16 Ultimate. It is a miserable excuse for a home editing program.  I render the film and export it only to have it freeze and say it has experienced a problem or it keeps exporting but a large X appears and continues through the rest of the movie.  I have found no way of working around these issues.  I went to their site as suggested in a blog and downloaded any updates suggested and was seriously optimistic.  Great, now instead of the X appearing, the program simply freezes and reports the "experience problem."  I even went so far as to cut out the offending segment, eliminated any transitions, titles, etc. but the program simply freezes in a new spot.If you think that this product is supported, forget it. You can pay some wizard for help or drink magic kool aid.  You cannot even figure out their manual which is about as large War and Peace but it does not seem to be of any value either.
