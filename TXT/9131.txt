This was the fourth battery I had to try and after two months it is working great. Lasts a long time. At first the computer wouldn't tell me how much battery power I had left and would suddenly shut down, but then it recently started telling me I have 10% so I don't have to worry about an improper shutdown. Happy this product is working well. Company also was very helpful by sending emails to let me know that if I had any problems they were there to help. Response was very quick.
