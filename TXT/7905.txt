The book is large (coffee table size.) I was expecting a normal size book.  In this format, it's hard to hold and read. The pictures are very good, and if it was mostly pics and little text, it would be a winner as a coffee table book.  The title is correct; it is a compilation of essays (reflections) by other people on Oprah's success.
