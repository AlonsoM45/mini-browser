Ray Price went on to have hit after hit. Although I know of his older songs, and like Release Me (he was the first to make it a hit), and Crazy Arms, I was most impressed with the sixties songs he did like: Night Life and For The Good Times. Singers like Ray Price, and all the other greats of their times, didn't have to have all the flashing lights, and other distractions, to keep the attention on them; they stood alone, with just their voice and music.; that was all Ray Price needed to be at the top.
