I just received this case in the mail today. I ordered it monday and got it by Thursday and it had to ship from california to maine. The feeling of the case is very sturdy. It is a well build case and feels great in the hand. This case is great if you looking to prevent your phone from scratches and are looking for a stylish case but with minimal protect to show off the beauty of your iphone. The back of the case is see through so you can see the apple logo. It is not white on the back as the picture shows. The devise when faced downwards on a smooth surface does not touch the surface but it would be a good idea to get a screen protector as there is very little room from the case to the screen. The only reason i gave it 4/5 is because i feel the case is a little over priced and the picture does show a white backing. I purchased it for $15 dollars when i feel it should have been more like $10 but still definitely worth the money. I would highly recommend this case to anyone looking for a good case with minimal protection.
