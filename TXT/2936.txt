i was so excited for this item to come in. it looks great and the protection it gives while still being able to fit in my pocket is awesome, but it never goes on right. it will randomly lock or unlock my phone, and it ALWAYS messes up my volume. during calls, while in doctors offices, i just do not get it. my defender series before this never had issues, except for the fact that it started falling apart within 3 months.
