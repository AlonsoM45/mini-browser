After almost a month of owning it, I'm thinking seriously to return it.I bought it mostly 'cause I needed an USB microSD reader for my son's R4, so I thought it would be nice to charge my smartphone as an added bonus to the reader. That part works quite good, I'm using it to charge my Bluetooth headphones to with no problems at all.The problem comes from the reader itself. When you put on the microSD card inside it, it stays on its "Slot" but when you place the reader into the USB port on the computer, the port seems to push the microSD card further inside the reader and then one of 2 things can happen: Either the PC doesn't know that the reader has a card inside it (You see the reader but not volume in File Explorer) or it DAMAGES THE microSD CARD!. Maybe the reader that I got is broken somehow but after inspecting it, I think it's a design flaw. It doesn't seem to have any way to stop the SD card from going further inside it AND it is a real pain to remove the card from the reader, I had to use a needle like for 2 minutes to take it out. It damaged my daughter's 16GB microSD card from her phone and an old 2GB microSD that I had lying around, which was not big deal (My daughter WAS!). It was literally burnt, I almost burn my fingers taking it out from the reader due to heat.I live in Venezuela and it certainly took a long time to come here, I bought it with some other things and I haven't read the return policies yet. I'll edit this when I found out more about this.So, in conclusion:1.- Fine charger, works as advertised2.- Very bad USB reader, but had to be used carefully.PD: I failed to mention that it worked fine on my sister's laptop but all the bad things happened on my PC. But the SD removal issue, happened regardless on where I used it
