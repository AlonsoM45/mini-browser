These boots are the best i've ever gave as gift. That is coming from a person whom loves to give away boots (people just love them). So when i gave these to my 17 year old son, he looked at me a little weird (like really mom?). But after using them for about 3 days, he fell in love; Calling them his, "babys". ONE thing to take note of; is that they do run small, a whole shoe size small. My son is a size 13, i got them a size 12, and they fit him perfect.
