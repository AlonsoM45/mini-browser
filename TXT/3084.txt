TL;DR:This is an amazing deal if you want all the apps and have more than 1 user, or want some of the apps and have 3 or more users.---Office 365 provides Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Onenote, Outlook, Publisher and Access for five people (of those 5 people, they can have it on a desktop and/or a tablet). The closet comparison to what Office 365 provides is Office Professional 2013. This version provides all of the previous mentioned apps for 1 person to use (only on their desktop I believe). Here is the math I figured:---Assuming that Microsoft Office releases a new version every 3 years,The price of Office Professional multiplied the amount of users using it$400 x 5 = $2000With this $2000 payment, you would have these apps forever for 5 people.The price of Office 365 multiplied by the amount of years the version exists$100 x 3 = $300Over a period of 3 years, you would have all of these apps for 5 people. Once Office is upgraded, you would have the new apps and restart the equation.---Therefore, if you plan on having 5 users, needing/wanting to use/have all of those apps and upgrading your Office every time there is an upgrade, you would save $1700. Now there are ways that Office 365 could be more costly, such as these:If you use all of the apps and have 1 user. *You should buy Office 365 Personal in this case *UNLESS the subscription key card if same price*If you only use some of the apps (Buying Office Home and Student 2013), have 2 or less users and upgrade every versionIf you only use some of the apps (Buying Office Home and Student 2013), have 4 or less users and upgrade every other version.---Overall I am very pleased with my purchase. Now me and my loved ones can all have Office on our computers and iPads for a relatively reasonable cost. This is a very smart purchase if you know exactly how you want to use the product.
