Okay, so there are some issues with this one. The main one being the size. You will have to be careful of what size milk steamer container you purchase- the big ones will NOT fit in this little guy. BUT I just put mine up on a pedastool (lucking coffee maker- LOL) and it works very well. I use shot glasses when making my espresso and it works perfectly. It does not have an automatic shut-off, so you will have to keep an eye on your espresso and make sure it isn't geting too watery.I LOVE mine!!! I have had it for over a year and a half and have NEVER had an issue with it. Easy to clean, easy to use and GREAT results! If you have never had an espresso machine before (this is my first) this is a GREAT place to start! Cheap- compared to most other machines, works AWESOME and makes super yummy espresso drinks!Thank you!
