The images do leave a certain lasting impact, but the story is wonderfully whimsical. A delightful book for young ones. I  know my 21 month old sat quietly listening. What I dont like about it is my friend who isn't too familiar with reading with expression wouldn't fair so well reading it to a toddler. Not an easy flow.
