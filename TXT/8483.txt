Changes, changes, changes.. One of the most difficult things societies can handle. And one of the most important things in becoming successful in life as well! Most of you know people who are panicky afraid of something going even in a little different way than they are used to. Most of you know people who look with huge eyes when something changes and can't understand what to do now. Most of you are those people. And if you can't answer the question who moved your cheese, this book is really for you!Who Moved My Cheese is one of the first books I've read when I started to be interested in self-development and I'm very glad I've read it. Spencer did a great job by making this book sound as a story, really simple story that a child could read with an interest. That makes this book very easy to read and understand.The main problem discussed in the book is "changes" and how people react to it. By using four fictional characters in the story, author basically wants to show us four types of people in real life and four different reactions to the changes. After reading the material, everyone could personalize one of the characters to himself and that will show you where you are in life. Even though the story is fictional, the result in the end is real. Spencer shows real life consequences that happens to any of the characters according to their reaction and action to the changes.The book is really like a moral and I believe it's one of the most important morals in life, because I believe that based on your reaction to changes you get the certain results. On the other hand, certain results come from having a certain reaction to changes. So if you want to see what might happen to you, read this book, and it will be like a laboratory experiment looking at the mice and watching what happens to each of them based on their behavior.So, who are you in the story? Or maybe more important, who are you going to become after reading this book? Share your thoughts!
