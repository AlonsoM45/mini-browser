I order these on the large size and I'm glad I did, as they fit perfectly as they are. So if I would have gotten my &#34;correct&#34; size it would most likely be snug. They are lovely though and more of a skin-tone color than an off-white I was expecting. Very comfortable but I have to be careful what I wear them with, because as I said, it looks like I'm not wearing leggings at all. Super fast shipping and good packaging! Thank you!
