First of all, these gloves have a terrible bulkiness, making it hard to function the bike controls, and its just not comfortable. Also, they weren't warm enough for me. Wore them in 30 degree weather, for a 10 minute ride. My fingers were frozen! Would not suggest this for cold weather under 40 degrees.
