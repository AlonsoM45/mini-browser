My daughter likes the jacket. However, the picture on the website showed a black jacket with hot pink on the sides. When the jacket arrived she was disappointed to see it was solid black. It is very soft & cozy so she decided to keep it because she did not like the other color options. If it looked like the picture I would give it 5 stars.
