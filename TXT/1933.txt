Bob Goff began his short wonderful book by telling how someone reached out to him in a loving and sacrificial way when he was a teenager in need. He went on to tell of many ways he and his family have dedicated much of their lives to doing the same for others. This should be inspiration and encouragement for anyone who desires to put love into action.
