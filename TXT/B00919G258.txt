The lace part of this dress was far longer that the picture had led me to expect. I'm 165cm and 51 kg (sorry people I'm European) and the dress (size 6) fits perfectly, but while the fabric part barely coveres my behind, the lace fell well under my knees. Frankly it made me look like someone&#8217;s grandma. The dress is still beautiful and quite well made, so I decided not to send it back and had it shortened.
