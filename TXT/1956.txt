If you live the life of a digital nomad, like myself, you will find this monitor amazing. I use it with my MacBookPro Retina computer (thunderbolt to displayport) and it works wonderfully. I've owned HP monitors before and never been real impressed with them. This monitor is closer to the DreamColor technology HP sells and is very high quality. I only wish it were just a tad bit lighter as 9lbs is still quite a bit but is not outside the range of easily portable in your suitcase :-)
