Not bad, very vicious little blade. Came with a few small stains on the blade, which may or may not be a CRKT issue. Doubtful it had to do with the seller. Sheath is a little hard to assemble, and not the best design. I do like the knife though, but not quite what I had hoped for. Still, excellent sharpness and the full tang is nice. Very lite weight also.
