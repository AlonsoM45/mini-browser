Received this on my porch on a Sunday. I was pleasantly surprised. Packaged well. I give three stars only because the 11 inches were very deceiving.  This is the smallest doll my daughter has. It's cute with its little creases and such, but I could have found something at Toys R Us for the same price, and bigger.  Not to say I won't order from them again, I will just have to get a bigger one. My daughter loves it all the same.
