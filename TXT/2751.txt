This game is one of the most annoying games I've ever played. I like these types of games, but the correct puzzle solutions either have to be executed repeatedly before they work, or the tools do not move into their correct places. Had I known this game was so riddled with technical problems I would not have purchased it. Execution needs much work.  A hint guide would be a plus as well. Very disappointing.
