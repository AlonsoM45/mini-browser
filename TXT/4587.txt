I wasn't certain this book could touch my soul and move me as much as the Kite Runner, but my doubts were completely unfounded.  Khalid Hosseini once again weaves a tale of love, sacrifice, human endurance in a land completely foreign to me but somehow brought to life with words that placed me right in the heart of the story.  I couldn't put the book down. Thank you Mr. Hosseini for painting such a vivid picture.
