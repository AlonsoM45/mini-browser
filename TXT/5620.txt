This suit is so incredibly cute with super bright colors and great quality. I purchased the size M and when I received the suit the top was a medium and bottoms were a large. The size medium top fits very small...would work great for a size A or B cup but larger would look funny due to the padding and underwire. I am keeping the suit because I love the color combo and I am going to try and find a matching top on my own.
