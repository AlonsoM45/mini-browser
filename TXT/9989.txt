I originally purchased my first keurig in 2010. It worked for about a year, then started pouring water out the back. I exhchanged it for a new one (LOVE Bath & Body Work's return policy!), but that one began doing the same thing maybe 4 months later. I returned it and went back to a regular coffee maker for a while. I found a Keurig on sale at Lowe's for $65, so gave it another shot only to have it get ruined by my dad's pet cockatoo (he has an obsession with electric cords and chew that out and somehow broke the top). Anyway, I was about ready to give up altogether on coffee when I saw the reviews on this! It makes a super quick cup o coffee without any risk of breaking! Seriously, this is the best purchase I've made in a long time! Well worth it!!
