My daughter is 5 years old and weighs about 56 pounds and probably 46 inch. tall. She usually wears a size 6X or 7. They fit her well. I bought her mediums hoping they would be a little big so she could wear them a little longer. They fit loosely, which is what I wanted and they are a little longer than her belt line. The material is a little thin, but they are perfect undershirts.
