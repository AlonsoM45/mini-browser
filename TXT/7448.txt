Professionally, I have been a consultant and writer for over three decades. Consulting has included providing assistance and support to those seeking to release fears, to realize understanding of inner experiences, and to expand conscious awareness. "The Sun Has No Shadow" by Etienne Pait is an asset of value for those seekers.When honoring the longing and yearning of heart to know one's real identity, old "mind stuff" emerges into view disrupting daily life. Etienne's shared life experiences and professional qualifications combine to provide a rare and significant supportive piece of material beneficial during a transformational process.It is rare today to find current written material by an author genuinely open to sharing sensitive and delicate experiences from his own life, experiences rarely shared except, perhaps, with a very trustworthy confidant. For those fearful of sensitive inner experiences little understood, there is now an author living in our time actually writing from his own life experience and has lived the ways and means to accomplish expanded conscious awareness.What a blessing Etienne's writing is, because he has carefully laid out case studies and examples along with comprehensive and practical steps the reader may successful apply to daily life to accomplish relief from fear - fear of the unknowns and reactive emotions often emerging during life transitions.When opening and beginning to read "The Sun Has No Shadow", a reader soon realizes they are not alone, for Etienne's sharing reveals him as a sincere fellow traveler in facing the challenges life presents. A page in the beginning of the book says it all regarding the quality of Etienne's character. It is titled 'In Gratitude'. Once one has read this paragraph, one knows they have found a loving friend.As a consultant assisting individuals facing life transitions, I thank you, Etienne Pait, for providing a written work earnest, sincere and comprehensive regarding a very delicate and sensitive subject. What a delight to now have available this supportive piece so precious to those longing in their hearts to know their real identity.
