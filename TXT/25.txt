most boys would eat this up. it has all the requisite characteristics of a movie for young boys. it was funny, it had some good fights, some out-smarting some bad guys, and explosions to boot. I didn't watch the whole thing with him, but picked up on some good lessons about being yourself and being true to friends. not a morality lesson, but hey--better than lots of garbage out there. he really enjoyed it and went back to see some parts again/show me. he would have watched it again immediately if I hadn't kiboshed the idea...-mom
