I love the shirt and wear it often! I always buy shirts in size small so naturally, that is the size I ordered for this shirt. It's a bit tight, in hind sight I would probably order a medium. I like my shirts fitted, but this is just a bit too tight (although not enough for me to return it or chose not to wear it!).
