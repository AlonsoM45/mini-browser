Alright, so I was looking for a Sega Dreamcast game that would peak my interest enough to get me obsessed with it, and this is one of them.  The music and gameplay is amazing, and the impressive graphics are seemingly flawless for the mystical fantasy rpg style this game has to do offer. Throughout the game you meet characters from different games who you can switch the main charcter with to clear levels.  Levels are caves, condemned buildings and palaces with dungeon chambers on the inside as mazes.  You go from one room to the next fighting enemies and capturing ones at your leisure to train for fighting.  At the end of searching the entire area, you fight a final boss, who you should be able to beat if you've leveled up enough.  It takes good tactic skills to ensure your victory as the game progresses, and knowing what armor to be equipped with.  By the way this game DOES NOT have a good case for armor either because you can collect barely any items without having to drop another one in exchange, then using it, to acquire the next item. You try to preserve and contain your list with healing items, but this in turn requires another sacrifice.  This is one of the only super annoying things about this game; that is the limited  bag to hold items.  You will find yourself repeating some levels over and over again because well, simply put, you weren't strong enough.  See, this game has a certain technique to it that you have to master.  It's called avoid as many enemies as you can unless you know they are weak and will level you up.  Otherwise you're gonna make super progress that amounts to nothing once you die!  What Timestalkers, you never heard of checkpoints?  And why is the main character so annoying?  Otherwise this is a must have classic.  It's the original disk, unlike the replica put on Ps2
