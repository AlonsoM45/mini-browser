This purse is super cute! I want another one in a different color. 2 things I dont like about it but its not that big of a deal. The straps are short when I put it on my shoulder the top of the purse rubs under my arm and its very floppy. It doesn't hold its shape when I put it down it just lays flat other then that I love it!!
