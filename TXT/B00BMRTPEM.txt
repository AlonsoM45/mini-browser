While I am not familiar with Phillipa Gregory's novels, I took a chance on this series because of my interest  in this moment in history. I was hoping for something along the lines of &#34;Vikings&#34;----- a balanced mix of drama & action. But this is more like Downton Abbey in tights, heavy on the romance while all the action (the battles, anyway) takes place off-camera. This is definitely aimed at a female audience The political situation at the end of the Wars of the Roses was extremely complicated , but it seemed to be over-simplified, at least as it was presented in the first episode. I may or may not  take a chance on the second episode, to see if the aura of Romance sets the tone of the entire series.
