Best product ever!!!  Especially the Apple Cinnamon.  They used to sell it in a vitamin outlet close to where I live, but they stopped so now I have to get it online.  They still sell vanilla, but I don't care for it.  I had a severe traumatic brain injury and it seems like Alive is the only product that I have ever found that keeps my blood sugar level stable.  It is my breakfast and keeps me satiated most of the day.
