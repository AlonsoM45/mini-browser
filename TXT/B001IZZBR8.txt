Light weight and easy to hang, these sconces are a welcome change from plain old pictures. I actually hung mine on either side of a framed picture and it completed the wall. Only drawback is the undersized candles they include that don't lie flat and centered in the glass holders. I am actually searching for replacement candles and/or glasses for it. It would be nice maybe if it was stained glass. Still, it was a good deal for the price and I am satisfied.
