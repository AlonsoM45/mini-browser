I'm a bit skeptical when it comes to the apps I purchase, and this app was no different. However, it did function as promised and &quot;immediately&quot; coverted a song I had that I couldn't listen to to a format that my Android tablet understood. I just wish it could have been a stand-alone on-tablet app instead of an upload/download kind of thing.
