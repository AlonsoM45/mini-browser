The rumble that it gives is a nice comfortable rumble and the volume does not need to be very loud. The sound quality is very impressive, not Bose quality, but better than I expected. The only thing that is bad about it is that the arm rests aren't very sturdy, as they keep coming loose every once and a while. But If you do as the warning stickers say and don't move the chair with the arm rests or get out of the chair using them, they will be in good hands.
