I had my reservations to how this book would have been having read so many 50 shades type of books.this book took me by surprise and was instantly new in its writing as well its plot growing just juicer with plots and hidden mysteries with every turn of page.In short would love to see how this series would take its turn as the story unfolds.Well written Anna Zaires.
