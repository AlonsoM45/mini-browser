I thought this would be a perfect piece for our new nursery. When the item arrived and we began assembling it, we realized that the top two shelves were broken and the bottom one damaged. It is such a hassle as we now have to return this and look for another that matches with the rest of the nursery furniture. I guess you get what you pay for.
