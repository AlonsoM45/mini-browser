I like this shirt- however I was expecting a lighter weight material (probably my own fault for not reading the description throughly though!) This is a medium weight cotton material.I really like it though- the fit is loose and the quality is excellent. Just to note the pink logo- writing is shimmery! Again not what I was expecting, but I like it! Under Armour is always a great choice
