It's a fantastic product. It does everything it says it does, has a super easy to use interface, and adds new games regularly, (on average every 2-3 days). The only thing I'd like to see for this to earn 5 stars is PS1 game support and codes. Once that happens then this will be the perfect device to enhance a second playthrough or save you hours upon hours of annoying grinding.
