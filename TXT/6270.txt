Item came VERY quickly. 5/5 on delivery time, especially so close to Christmas using the free delivery! Item is in wonderful shape. No frays or discolorations. The pictures are all brilliantly colored and high detailed aside from the darker one, which is usually covered anyways so I can overlook it. Material is good quality for the price. If you're considering this product, I recommend it.Ignore the rating bit, I always rate accordingly and...for some reason it believes the wallet is a toy and therefore wants to know how educational and fun it is...both of which would be 1/5 >_>TL;DR :Great productGreat imageryHighly recommend.
