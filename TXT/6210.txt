I like these sandals but the strap is a little tight around the toe.  It may be because I wore them for the first time while out walking for a long day in DC.  They are super cute and overall comfortable.  I think if the leather stretches a little, I will be fine.  The sole is a little rubbery but it doesn't take away from the sandal.
