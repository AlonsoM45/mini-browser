The acting was OK, and the filming.  However, I was very disappointed that they alter a number of Biblical stories in details.  I had hoped to use this in one of my missions classes at the college level, but the alterations prevent that.  Sadly, by altering several items, they lose the true impact the Bible gives.  Man seems always to be trying to better the Bible, and it cannot be done.
