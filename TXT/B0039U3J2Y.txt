I ordered this product thinking it would come with the connection cord (silly me). But no, it comes individually! So don't expect to actually be able to USE this product upon arrival, my fellow Amazon shoppers! Because you can't. There's no cord. There's no installation CD. You'll have to order those seperately. I would comment on how well the actual product is, but I couldn't plug it into my computer so I have no idea.Had to return this item and recieved full refund, which I am thankful for.But the seller does not inform the buyer like he/she should.
