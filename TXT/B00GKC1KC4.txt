This dress is not meant for the shy and modest girl. This dress is very sexy with it's open key hole neckline so if you don't like showing cleavage, do not buy this. The material is a simple cotton/poly/spandex so there is stretch to this. I'm 5' 6" and I weigh 140lbs (36-29-40). I read a lot of reviews talking about how this is cut small but I disagree. I ordered a large but really a medium would have suited me better. I'll keep it as sending back to China would be more of a hassle. I do have to say, I was VERY impressed to have received this dress one week after I ordered it! I wasn't expecting it til mid May.  I'm very pleased with this dress and feel super pretty in it. I'd definitely recommend a good push up bra and spanx to go underneath and really bring out the desired effect. This would make a great first date dress, just broke up with my boyfriend dress, or girls night out dress. It's light weight so if you're on the dance floor, you won't sweat too bad and if a drink is spilled on you, it will absorb quickly...win, win. If you're thinking about buying this, do it...you won't regret it as long as the sizing is on point.
