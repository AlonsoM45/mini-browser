IT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING TO RECEIVE A BATTERY OF 4400, INSTEAD OF THE ONE ORDERED ACCORDING TO THE ONLINE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION WHICH SPECIFIED 7000 mAH. SO THE CAPACITY OF THE BATTERY RECEIVED WAS ALMOST HALF OF THE ONE PURCHASED ACCORDING TO THE ADVERTISED PRODUCT. NEVERTHELESS, I ENDED VERY SATISFIED FOR THE MERCHANT IMMEDIATE AND POSITIVE RESPONSE TO MY CLAIM. I WISH TO IMCREASE MY EVALUATION TO THREE STARS NOT TO THE ITEM BUT TO THE MERCHANT IN RECOGNITION TO HIS GOOD ATTITUDE.
