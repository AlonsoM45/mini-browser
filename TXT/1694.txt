I enjoyed reading the depot. If you enjoy reading books that end on a cliff hanger, like a soap opera, then you will enjoy this book also. I personally do not like soaps. They are a waste of time. When I get the time to sit down and read a book I don't want to be angry with the author at the end of it. I choose short stories because they allow me to enjoy a little down time  without wondering when I will get a chance to finish a book. Unlike other prequels I have read this one actually leaves you feeling like some one stole your brownie after the first bite. Before you read this make sure she has published THe Library first.
