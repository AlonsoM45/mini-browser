We just got a new matress and had to have something to cover it because lets admit nothing is more gross than sleeping on a disgusting looking matress at night and its not very romantic either... Well being the poor people we are we thought we would buy this cheap cover. Now we have a 1&1/2 year old boy that LOVES to spill everything and be messy like every other two year old. This matress cover keeps your matress clean BUT so can a tarp. You might as well put a tarp on your mattress because it would cost the same, feel the same, and sound the same. It is super noisy....(if you didnt get that by now) at first we were like oh its no problem but after 6 months of dealing with it well its getting pretty annoying. we tried putting 6 quilts between us and the matress and its just as loud as before. it is soooo bad. if you even shift in bed the other person gets woken up. if you get up at night the other person gets woken up. I can hear my husband roll around in bed when im watching tv in the other room (we live in a apartment) honestly just save more money and get the kind that isnt plastic.
