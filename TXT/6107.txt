I was recently diagnosed with breast cancer of the right breast -- second time around for me after being cancer free for 16+ years.  A lot of great changes have taken place since my first surgery (1997), a lumpectomy and lymphnode excision followed by radiation; e.g. sentinel node biopsy (made standard of practice 1 yr. following my surgery); Oncontype DX test.  Through Dr. Love's Breast Book, I learned about the advancements made since 1997, and learned about the pros and cons of aromatase inihibitors.  One big change since my first cancer in 1997, is that chemotherapy is not always the adjuvant treatment of choice depending on the type of cancer.  I learned from Dr. Love's book that because I am estrogen and progesterone receptor positive, and the fact that I am negative for HER-2/neu, my cancer would not benefit from chemotherapy.  This was confirmed by my doctors.  For these reasons and others, I have opted for a bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction.  I have been informed that I will be admitted for only 23 hrs. following surgery, not the &#34;few days&#34; admission stated in the book.  That is the only thing in my experience I have found different from that presented in the book.  I found the book very beneficial in that it made me a more informed patient and therefore able to communicate better with my medical team.
