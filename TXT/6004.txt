Product arrived in a timely manner in good condition.  Unfortunately for Me, I bought this thinking it would work with My blue yeti microphone, but alas no.  The shock mount is for a normal skinny type mic and the mounting thread is a non standard size so I could not put My yeti shock mount onto this arm.  At some point in the future I may get a mic that will fit this for use, but for the time being its not in the cards.  Good product tho.  I did set it up on the desk and it would have filled the bill perfectly if only the fitting would have supported putting My mic on it.
