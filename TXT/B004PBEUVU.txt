I spent a good deal of time looking for a multi CD stereo, and this one fit the bill perfectly.  It looks great, sounds great, and meets my expectations for an inexpensive audio system.  The only negative comment I have would be how noisy the actual changer operates.  Otherwise, it is absolutely wonderful to listen to my large CD collection again.  Just call me old now and be done with it.  ~ Enjoy
