This book opens your heart and mind to what is going on in the spirit as we live out our faith and worship. I have sensed these things and seen a few of them with me eyes closed in visions. To see them as they happen with eyes open, I will pursue. Hearing Blake share them, makes reality of the Kingdom come to earth.
