I ordered it thinking it would be blue...but I suppose I just didn't read the whole description and it's black/dark-purple. So, that is really my only problem, and that is pretty much my fault...but if you guys either do have it in blue or get it in blue...cause I just like blue and black together...I'd like to order a new case from ya then. It holds up really well. It's a nice strong sturdy case and the price is pretty awesome too.
