The light is much too directional and only covers a field of view of about 10 degrees each side. The microphone is very loosely held on its mount; it flops around like a fish out of water. The zipper on the bag broke the second time I used it and it's not big enough to carry, well, anything. I'm giving this 2 stars because the stand/mount/carrier is very versatile and I'll be using it often with a different light/microphone.
