Since Army Basic Training I have tried to stay with Asics running shoes.  In Afghanistan the PX only carries Brooks and some other brand.  I was forced to buy the Brooks which hurt my feet and fell apart.  I found the Asics GEL-Extreme 33 on Amazon for a great price and bought them.  My feet are thanking me and I'm back to running.  I just completed 500 miles, and am heading to 1,000 miles.  Asics never let me down.
