I would rate it higher, but the wheel for it is made of plastic.  Won't last long at all if you have a dog with any kind of strength.  They get going on the trolley and that thing will break when it hits the end if they have anything besides a fast walk going on or if they pull really hard.  I had to go to the hardware store and buy a metal one.
