First thing that stood out was that the seller was fast to respond to questions and gave clear and concise answers. Very professional, nice to talk to.Having previously purchased a watch from Amazon, the second thing that stood out was the packaging. The watch box was packaged securely and presented no chance to damage from the shipping process.Then there's the watch itself which is absolutely stunning. Personally I'm not going to wear it every day because everything about it commands for a special occasion.Overall the watch arrived fast and I'm fully satisfied with the purchase. If you are thinking about buying it I would recommend that you do so now because it sells out fast and I've made the mistake of waiting the first time I saw it and had to wait for a while before it was back in stock again.
