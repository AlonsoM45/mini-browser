A truly fitting sequel to the first book. A bit more variety a bit more fun. All in all basically perfect. I would recommend it a something to keep on your coffee table or a table by your big overstuffed recliner. Its just a great book to dive into for a while and come back refreshed and always leaves you thinking.
