First of all when I received the flat iron I immediately wanted to try it out. Upon turning it on it filled my whole house with a stench of burning plastic. I thought well its brand new maybe it'll go away. It didn't. The smell occurs every time I turn it on.Also I have thin slightly wavy shoulder length hair. It doesn't take much from a flat iron to straighten my hair. However with this useless iron it takes me at least 45 mins to get my hair straight and then about thirty minutes later (after my hair completely cools) it is right back to how it was before I flat ironed it.This iron doesn't get up to 430 degrees I don't care what the description says. It also pulls and yanks out my hair.Just turn away right now. If you would like a good flat iron I replaced this piece of crap with a jilbere porcelain flat iron. Works amazing! And it's not that much more expensive. I suggest looking that one up!Happy shopping!
