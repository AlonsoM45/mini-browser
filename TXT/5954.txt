After having these for a few months, i have bad news to report. The first couple of prints from these cartridges were fine, but after a couple of months of inactivity, these cartridges will now only print blank pages. It has something to do with the ink sensor inside the cartridge. After much research, i have concluded that cheaply refilled dell series 2 ink cartridges are not making proper contact with the Encoder Band inside the printer, which is responsible for squirting the ink out of the cartridge onto the paper. I have also seen news that ALL dell series 2 cartridge ink sensors CANNOT be reset after they are used, therefore in theory, all refilled dell series 2 cartridges will have problems. I also have two black cartridges that i bought from Abacus that i put in just to see, and after a couple of weeks they are both working fine. Maybe theres something Abacus is doing that Enviroinks is not. I cannot guarantee that all cartridges are like this, but all should be weary.
