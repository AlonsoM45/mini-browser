Looks nice and does a good job of protecting the tablet when I carry it around in a bag or rest it down on a hard surface. Quality seems good so far.The only issue I have is that the tablet does not fit snugly in the case so when I hold it upright in landscape orientation it slides down in the case and the bottom edge of the screen becomes blocked by the case which means the back, home symbols etc. are partially blocked and hard to press. Would suggest Velcro to secure the tab at the bottom as it slides out under the weight of the tablet allowing the tablet to move down.
