I like this diaper cover. I'm not sure it would have fit her at 4lbs, but it fits around 7lbs for sure, which is why I just give it 4 stars. My daughter has itty bitty chicken legs and is very long and skinny, so I think that is why it didn't fit quite right at first. I love that the aplix tabs overlap. The snap versions of this diaper, which we also have, don't fit quite as well since they don't overlap at the waist. It's adorable on babies. Gives them a larger bottom so we had to go up to 0-3 instead of newborn clothes when she wears these diapers. It holds everything in, unlike the disposables. Definitely recommend this diaper for those first few months before the one size diapers fit!
