I bought this cage for my two chinchillas because i wanted to put them together and have them be in a bigger can they were currently in. But when i recieved the package the first time not only were many of the parts rusted but they were bent or broken so i had to return it for another one. When I recieved the second one, it was still damaged but I wasn't going to return it because I had waited long enough to recieve it. Most of the problems I had to fix on my own which cause assembly to take longer than nessecary.But once it was assembled, it looked great and my chinchilla Coco (the other one passed unfortunately before he got to experience the cage) loves the cage. Its spacious and gives her alot of exercise room that she doesn't even know what to do with it.If i could have I wish I could have requested a fragile sticker or something on it in order to ensure the product is tampered with.
