I got through this book pretty quick and it was pretty good. It has the right amount of action mixed with romance. But something didn't really wow me. The writing was also good, so that's not the issue. I didn't really connect with the characters and I don't know why because I actually liked them. Hmm... I'm so torn! I wanted to like this book so much because it seemed so great and it is pretty good, but I guess something just didn't connect me to the novel. Weird. Maybe this isn't really my type of book.If you love this genre, I really recommend it! It's a great book and fans of the genre will love it. I'm just not a big fan of action and stuff. :P Anyways, since this isn't a bad novel it deserves 3 stars!
