Drobot, the new lightcore character from the tech is not being sold a lot. Why? Well first you can't switch paths, you have to reset it. Anyways, he helps a lot whens its like four Arkeyan Defenders or Axecutioners. His attacks are pretty weak, but his soul gem makes his thrusters damage enemies. Activision really needs to think it again. You know, I thought Activision was going to take a step forward in Skylanders, but didn't. The blasters and bladegear paths don't really make a difference in the character and really I think you can expect more from the giant, Bouncer in this case. I wouldn't say that Drobot is the worst in my conclusion, but that drobot isn't like the rest of the Skylanders. Leave comments or questions on Skylanders Giants. :-)
