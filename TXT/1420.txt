This microwave is smaller than our previous 1100 watt and that is a plus because the inside room is still more than adequate. I don't mind that the light doesn't come on until it's cooking even though that was a negative for some purchasers. I don't think it's any louder than our other one...now I'm waiting to see if it's going to last LONGER than the old one! I certainly hope so...my very first microwave was a very large Sharp Carousel that we used for over 20 years! The second Sharp Carousel lasted only 5 years! I certainly hope the Panasonic does better than that! So far...so good!I forgot to say why the four star rating...it's because the ease of programming certain foods is not as easy as it was with our previous microwave. I am very much computer/programming literate but this one seems to be a little more unnecessarily complicated...just sayin'!!
