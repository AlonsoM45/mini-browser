Wow, this really stands up to the buzz about garcinia. My friends are happy about my weight loss, but what is amazing to me is how easy it makes it to not be hungry when I am usually craving snacks or sweets. I just have this relaxed easy feeling during the day that feels great. I feel energized but not hungry even during the later afternoons when we usually grab a coffee and a treat. I don't need the treats to get me through. I'm all about the occasional treat but now I feel like it's a choice rather than a quick sugar high to get me through the afternoon. I'm more than happy with the garcinia and like that it's natural and safe. The weight loss comes naturally without the snacking because I'm using up the fat stored in my hips - thank God!
