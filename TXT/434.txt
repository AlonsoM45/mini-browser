Dev Shannon is a good bad boy.  He is smart as whip and equally creative in getting the job done.  Personally charming with a dash of redneck.  I like the descriptions of everywhere he went in pursuit of his jobs. You feel like you could go to the city he is describing and walk right into the bar he is sitting in.  I highly recommend this book if you want an adventure that you will not be able to predict what is going to happen or how he is going to get the job done. I enjoyed the writing style used in this book, it is always a step ahead
