Pros:No input lag (Had input lag on the Elgato when used with a Asus monitor)Small and PortableRan the coolest between the Elgato and HDPVR2Roxio's device is supported by multiple programs.Roxio has a built in LIVE stream program which lets you stream directly to Twitch.tv (Hauppauge and Elgato will soon follow)High bitrate while recordingAmazing Price. I purchased it for $98 and I have seen people get it for less.Worked flawlessly out of the box. No need to download codecs..etcCons:Too light, Feels cheap. (The Elgato and HDPVR2 feels better)Does not include any HDMI/Component cables. At $150 retail I would expect it to.The Design. I think the USB should have been in the middle so it doesn't interfere with the output or inputs.Neither the Roxio, Elgato, or the Hauppauge HDPVR2 would display the image as crisp/sharp if I was to bypass the products.HDPVR1 still has better raw recordings than all the external capture cards I have tested so far. Elgato comes in close second with the Roxio and HDPVR2 following.Program randomly stops running after streaming for about 45mins. (This can be fixed in the future)Conclusion: At $100 you really are getting the most bang for your buck. I had a really good experience with the Roxio. I would recommend this product when it's on sale. At retail price I would be looking at Elgato's and/or Hauppauge's products to get the include cables at around the same price.
