I am now officially a fan of the Kinncaid brother series. Jaycee gives the perfect balance of  intense suspense and hot 'n'steamy !!!  I'm already bummed that I am starting book 3 and there are only 5 Kinncaid brothers...... Maybe Katie and Jock will adopt.........  anyway, I am absolutely loving this series, I can't seem to put them down!!!
