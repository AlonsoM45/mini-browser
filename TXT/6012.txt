Soulene is an engaging, creative and historically edifying novella. Children (of all ages) will love it: while the story traces a potentially real figure in an historically accurate context, it is no less magical for its truthfulness. Soulene, the central figure, is training to be nurse, or "healer" in the parlance of the story. On her travel to her schools, in England and France, she meets and offers medical help to a wounded knight (whom she will meet again under surprising circumstances), flees for her life with her two faithful dogs and a new animal friend she calls "Horse," and interacts with many other engaging characters. The description of her life in the woods is engrossing, taking the reader to a captivating place which feels like something between "Harry Potter" and "The Wind in the Willows." It is also a coming of age story that echoes "True Grit" in the manner in which this young girl defines a task and sets out, against significant obstacles, to accomplish it. My kids are eagerly awaiting (a slightly longer) volume 2.
