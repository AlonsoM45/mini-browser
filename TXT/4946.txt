First of all I was under the impression that Pink Zebra products could not be sold on Amazon? The sprinkles melt well, but the warmers or "simmer pots" as they call them do not last well. Since Jan of 13 I have had 4 burn out and 2 lightbulbs go out in 6 separate warmers.. The company is a hassle to deal with. UGH I recommend to stick with the store brands.. Smell just as good without the hassle..
