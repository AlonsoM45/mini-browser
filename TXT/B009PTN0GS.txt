I watched the gold box timer like most of you and when it reached zero i rapidly clicked on it, saw the price and went straight to check out. I look at it like this, if you was one of those people who needed to see specs first, you missed out on a 50 inch TV for 288 dollars. I don't care what brand it is, for that price and yes Walmart customers have given this TV decent reviews for twice the amount. This won't be my family TV, perfect for a game room.. Man cave.My TV gets here on Friday and I will update.You can always clear it out of in box if you didn't want it. Just my opinion.
