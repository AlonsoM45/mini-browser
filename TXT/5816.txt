If you like heart racing, tense, can't put it down kind of books you will love this! I started reading and immediately I knew I wasn't getting much work done until I finished through the book, it was too good. It had me on the edge of my seat, biting my nails one minute, laughing out loud the next, and crying another.I  love that the book brings up the point that sex trafficking isn't something that simply happens in a foreign country, it's something that happens every day in the United States, and in places you think it might not happen.Being a full time student, working full time and having a family, I dont get a lot of time to read, however over the summer I will be reading the rest of the Pastor Butch (main character) books!
