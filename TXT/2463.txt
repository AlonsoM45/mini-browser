I was very disappointed when i got my journal. It clearly says The Twilight Journals (The Twilight Saga) to me that means you get the four books. I was hoping it would be that but it wasnt. I opened the package only to see it was just the one journal. If i would have known it wasnt all of them i wouldnt of ordered this. I had read the reviews nd all of them said they received 4 so I decided to order it but I only got one book .. I was very disappointed I wanted it to give has a gift ... Not happy with this product
