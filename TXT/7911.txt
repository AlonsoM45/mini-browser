Not too sure about this game yet.  It has a solo setting that is timed, but doesn't seem to give you much time to win. If the number called isn't on your card, you have to tap an arrow to get the next number.  There is a &#34;social&#34; setting, but I haven't had anyone else on to compete with. I'll give it a few more days, but may end up deleting it.
