I have been using skinomi screen protectors for years on my phones so I went with this one for my iphone 5.  It is easy to put on and by 1-2 days it is completely clear with no bubbles or dust underneath.  Just follow the instructions and it should turn out great like every one I have done in the past.  It is a little scary using the liquid solution but as long as you soak up the excess solution it seems to be fine.  I trusted it on my brand new iphone so that says something.
