I really liked the zipper on the side and the velcro on the other. I have bad hips so bending over to try and get my feet into other boots is hard. But with these i can just slip in the side and with a quick zip be ready to go. I would highly reccomend to anybody whos not very flexible or has joint problems because of how easy they are to put on and take off,
