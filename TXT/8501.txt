Richard Branson - one of the most brilliant entrepreneurs in today world. He managed to create very successful businesses in many areas like music, airways, space trips, trains, mobile operators and many more by establishing Virgin company. Starting as a publisher of a student newspaper and becoming multi-billionaire. Richard is one of my most inspiring personalities and this book is exactly what you need to start making your dreams come true.Screw It, Let's Do It covers everything you need to make successful business and enjoy the processes all the way. I've read almost all of Richard's books and even though I didn't get any more knowledge of his life journey in this book, it's still a very good reading to summarize everything I've read in his previous books. It's short, it's simple, it's interesting to read and it has everything you need to start dream building and believing in your even the most crazy ideas.The book is called under the most favorite Richard's expression and it represents the action mode. One of the things that brought Branson to billionaires is action, and Screw It, Let's Do It explains it all. I remember times in my life when I was delaying things and that didn't bring anything good. If I have told myself &#34;Screw it, let's do it&#34; I believe many things would have turned out much better. Richard doesn't say that uncalculated risk is a good thing, but he says that if the risk is measured the the action should be brought in immediately. And he proves that by his achievements!What do you think? Do you delay things and regret about it later?
