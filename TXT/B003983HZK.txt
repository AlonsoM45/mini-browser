I received this razor for free from Gillette, it was such a nice surprise. This razor has five extra thin blades. I have to shave in the evenings otherwise my face and head get razor burns and such, I tried to shave in the morning with this razor too, but I still got razor burns. So if you are a morning shaver it might not work that well for you, but I highly recommend you try it for yourself. It is a five star razor for me!! I am officially going to use Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual razors! I shave my entire head and face every other day and the blades last me for a month or so. Overall great razor this is a must try.
