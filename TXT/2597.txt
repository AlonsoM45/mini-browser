This tea tastes so much better than the gunpowder green tea I have been buying.  I am also a bit of a history buff and even though this may not be from Japan, it is of the type used for the Japanese Tea Ceremony which I perform among a few friends every once in a while.  And when I'm not using it for the ceremony, it comes in single serving pouches so I can just sit down and enjoy a nice cup of tea!  This makes excellent iced tea as well!  Highly recommend this Matcha Tea!
