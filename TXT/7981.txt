There are a ton of reviews out there on this particular knife.  It caught my eye on knifecenter.com so I decided to take a closer look and looked at reviews here on Amazon as well as YouTube.  There are some really good reviews on YouTube. Overall I like this knife.  I bought it to give away as a gift, but I may end up buying another one to keep.I bought the straight blade, not serrated, which is what I prefer. I think the blade steel is decent quality.  It&#699;s the same steel as my Spyderco Tenacious, strong enough, and able to sharpen up fairly easily.  I like the handle grip, it&#699;s very good and feels comfortable in hand. No blade play up, down, or side to side when it&#699;s deployed.  I like the secondary lock on the top of the frame.  That&#699;s a nice added safety feature.  I&#699;m not too keen on the pocket clip.  That looks a little...low-tech if I can say that.  I wish it was a little more agressive looking and not so FAT.  And then the knife overall is a little wide.Other than that I have no real complaints.  These are my first impressions right out of the box...and I haven&#699;t actually put it to use, BUT...I can tell this knife will take a beating. The good news: It&#699;s not a hundred dollar knife that I&#699;ll be afraid to put to hard use.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it&#699;s a little wider than expected, and that silly looking pocket clip.
