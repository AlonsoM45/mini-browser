I had tinea versicolor really bad on my stomach and arms. It was embarrassing and nothing seemed to help at all. But this, take my word for it, you will not regret it. This stuff had visual improvements on my skin in a 24hour span. For having this nasty skin issue for over 6months, of say this thing is worth every penny!  I urge you to try this!  2-3 sprays at least twice a day on the area of your skin and you will be better in no time!
