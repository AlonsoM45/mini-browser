This book is full of facts about the history we have never been told about before of all the once diverse ancient Christianities which were banned and suppressed, only to be rediscovered in the 20th century. This has caused many, including myself, to question &#34;Christianity&#34; as it is being taught and preached to us today.....and surely anyone else who reads this book!!!!
