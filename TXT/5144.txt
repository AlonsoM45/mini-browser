When i received it i tried straight away and it's wonder curler but you have to be becareful because you will not have a perfect gloves and you can hurt your fingers very easy .I was expecting to have all curl will be twisted but i have very long hair my ends looks like if it's straight the result i got wavy nice hair but i need to practice more on it so i can get better result .Am hoping that i will not hurt myself .
