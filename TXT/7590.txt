Wow where do I start.  I was gifted this book for a honest review. Let me say this book was so good I went and bought it . It has a very strong story line which really sucks you in . A strong bear hero. Lots of chasing and love scenes to make you sweat a little. I liked the first book but Wow this one was better.
