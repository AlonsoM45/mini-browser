I wish I would have spent the extra money for a better brand.  My daughter is only 11 and growing constantly so I thought this was a good option. I gave it to her on Christmas and she has worn it maybe 7 or 8 times but the buckle finish is already coming off and the belt finish is cracking, so instead of saving money it is going to cost me.
