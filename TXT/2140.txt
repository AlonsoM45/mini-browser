Nice fiber optic sight, and it produces a red/orange dot that makes you able to point your shotgun on target very fast, again it's "A VERY NICE Fiber Optic Sight", and well worth the purchase price, and it fit my Mossberg 500A 12ga shotgun with 18.5" barrel very nicely.  I would recommend this sight, and the "Seller", I give both a (5* Rating)JM
