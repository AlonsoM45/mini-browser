I decided to try these heads after reading many reviews, and knowing I wanted to give Evans another try but go clear this time(my last heads were Onyx and left me with mixed feelings) I've only spent a few minutes tuning and my toms already sound much better than before. Great sound, and a good price. Not sure how long they'll hold up but my next heads will definitely still be G2s.
