This knife sharpener will sharpen your knife, but you must be really careful as not to have an accident, and cut the hand (fingers) that hold the body of the knife sharpener, if not super careful it would be easy for the sharpener to slip in your fingers, and cause a painful cut to your hand, or fingers.  Again the knife sharpener will sharpen your knife, but just use caution as to finger placement while sharpening your knife.  Final Note:  &#34;This Knife Sharpener Will Sharpen Your Knife&#34; !
