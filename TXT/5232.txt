I have VERY thin hair. Most products I use on my hair, especially conditioner and heat protection spray, leave my hair greasy. I absolutely love this product. I recommend applying it to damp hair rather than dry hair. It leaves my hair silky and soft. I will definitely continue using it and I recommend others to give it a try!
