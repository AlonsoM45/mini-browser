Of all the cases I have gotten all the reviews I read on this case, this case was the most disappointing. I didn't feel there was adequate protection with this case for the same price you could get a much more durable case, one that provides more defense against falls or drops. It's got two layers of the flimpsy rubber stuff. I might look cool and if that's what your looking for than this is your case, otherwise shop around go otterbox or a few others that's are just as awesome.
