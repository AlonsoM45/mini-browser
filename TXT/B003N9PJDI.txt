The product is great!the design is very cool, shiny black not fancy stuff, just black.The sound is very good. the highs are very clear the bass is very deep and full. Middle great as well.But you have to know how. First of all, change your Equalizer. it REALLY!! makes a huge difference. second, place the sound system on a dresser or something like that, it increases the bass incredibly and makes it even better.Linking up with the devices (iphone 4s and macbook pro) worked perfectly fine if you read the instructions.But: sometimes (once every ten minutes) the sound experiences small problems. but they don't last half a second so it's fine if you're not a soundphile person.I love them and can only recommend them.Update: Since many people experienced problems after a short while I just wanted to say that I bought it four months ago, use it everyday and didn't have single problem!
