The book Comforting Children in Crisis was written by Group Publishing Company to serve as a tool in helping every professional who interacts with kids to know what to do in any given situation where a kid is considered in a crisis situation. The sections are organized into a short anecdote and followed by differing tips, depending on the person that tip section is meant for. This method of organization is easy to understand, and makes most sections easy to find.This book has some issues, such as attempting to address everything conceivable that could happen to a kid, instead of focusing on principles. The attempt to deal with twelve different topics in under two-hundred pages makes the book seem more like a list of tips or to dos than a helpful resource. The tips themselves are good, if repetitive at times, but take up more space than anything that is likely to help a person understand the given situation and what they need to do about it, other than a short list of what to say and what not to say and one or two ways to help. Granted, this book is written for the general public, but the differing sections of tips for counselors and other professionals seems almost excessive. Also, it just tries to make things into a cookie-cutter list of actions instead of principles to employ, and is less flexible than would be desired for a usable tool.The negative side being dealt with, this book is an excellent quick-reference guide for anyone who has no clue what to do, and has some good ways to do triage on a kid to figure out who they need to talk to. The main use for this book would be to both remember some guidelines about what&#8217;s happening, and also to give the worker a refresher on each item being addressed. That is what I think of Comforting Children in Crisis.
