As this story offers its as analysis of the Passion of Christ it illuminates parts  of if, confounds others, and merely relays others. Toibin holds up as mirror for us to see ourselves as we recall those events and challenges our comfort in the story. A wonderful reflection and should be required reading for all to know Mary's humanity.
