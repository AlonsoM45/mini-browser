Bought this tablet for my 9 year old son as a gift. it worked for 1 month and now its inoperable. Powering it on to the android symbol on the screen is as far as it goes. Wont proceed booting after that. Ive searched high and low for troubleshooting advice and have come up with nothing. I am beyond disappointed and angry.
