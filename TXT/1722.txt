This title was very misleading. I thought there would be patterns. Even one would have been nice. Title should have been Websites to help you learn to crochet for baby.....oh wait, you don't need a book after reading that title! This book started out like it was going to share a pattern, kinda, then it jumps to web sites that allow you to print patterns. Overall this book was confusing. If I could I wouldn't have given any stars.
