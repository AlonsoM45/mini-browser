Shipping was quick and came in a timely manner with good packaging. The cables don't have a locking mechanism, but they have a snug fit and don't feel like they're going to fall out. The only issue I have is that the image shows a cable without a 90 degree connector. The assumption is that both cables are as pictured, however one of the cables had a 90 degree connector on one end. Not sure if this is intentional or somebody grabbed the wrong one off the shelf, but the second product image kinda looks like a 90 degree connector. It wasn't a big deal for me, both cables installed just fine, but it might be something to keep in mind if 90 degree connectors won't work in your application.
