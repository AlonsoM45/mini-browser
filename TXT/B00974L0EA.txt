I've heard that OtterBox cases are really nice and getting this commuter series proved it to me. This case doesn't give too much bulk which I was worried about. It took a few days more than expected to arrive with free supersaver shipping but it was worth the wait. I would recommend this to people prone to dropping their phones, or anyone who wants the security of a really good phone case.
