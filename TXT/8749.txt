This is actually a very good book. I originally bought his thinking it was about the elementals of the watchtowers...it is not. so i was disappointed. but i did read it and has been put to use more then some of my other books. I would recommend for beginners..since this book talks about the elements of earth,fire,water,air...(not elementals)
