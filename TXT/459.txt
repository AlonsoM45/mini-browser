I had a complicated set up for my screen. I needed a clamp that can stay perpedicular to each other so i can suspend a screen. It sure did. the slit on the top allows you to suspend the screen at different positions. it comes with all the screws etc so dont need to buy any additional hardware if your set up is simple.
