In this case I agree, the first season of my little pony was the best and I'm pretty sure anyone else would agree THAT they shouldn't/couldn't have done it any other way. Which would make people wonder how they are gonna attempt to try to live up with the huge success of the first season. Well just ask the fans how they did. From the beginning of it to the end of it. Boy did they do it up right. I love every single last episode and then there are ones you can't live without.
