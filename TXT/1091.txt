I was hesitant when ordering the item because of a review stating the stand is not high enough. I measured mine at just over 7 feet tall. For my family's purposes this works out just fine.  The assembly was not complicated at all and I was expecting much more of a project. I received mine 3 days from the time I ordered. I must live fairly close to an Amazon fulfillment center.
