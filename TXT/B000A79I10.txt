Without a doubt, if you are thinking about purchasing these lights just do it, you won't be disappointed. Keep in mind the lights are packaged with a flush mount box that is needed.  These lights are not designed to mount to a standard in wall outlet box.I bought two of them for our front deck/carport area as they offered the utilitarian design and flush mount installation that I was looking for.
