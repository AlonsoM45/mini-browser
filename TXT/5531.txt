This duvet set looks very good in the picture. However, the reality of it isn't the same.While it looks to be shades of brown - one of the prominent water-type markings is very black.  As well, one of the pillows is a very ugly green, which does not go with the set at all.Although I told the seller that I was returning the set as it was not as described - I was still required to return it at my OWN expense.  Then, 20% was deducted from my refund for a "restocking charge"?I lost money and time on this mechandise and I would recommed to anyone thinking of buying this duvet set or dealing with this vendor, to think twice!
