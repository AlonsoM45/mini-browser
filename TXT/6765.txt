Arrived early! I bought two of these for my partner and I. Everything we do is electronic as far as paper work goes, so we are either taking up a bunch of space between the iPad, tablet, phones, and tablet/iPad keyboards. We got these yesterday and plugged them in today and they are working great! The blue light that everyone is posting about really isn't a problem in the office. I was actually able to replace my power strip with a smaller one, so everything looks nice and tight and less of a mess. Thanks for the speedy service!
