I don't leave a lot of reviews but this app has been out a while an d deserves a review. When you get a free app it is hit or miss.  This is a great story. Read in a clear voice. Interactive part is basic, touch the animal and it swims away, giving the child the chance to count each before it zooms off the page. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because the page after the interactive animals it simply says &quot;2 Seahorses!&quot; for example but there are no seahorses.. I would have liked to have seen the animals too. Teaching your child anything involves a lot of repetition. Giving them another chance to count would've reinforced the number counted better.  But all in all, most free books are not always this well done. Thank you for giving us a great book.
