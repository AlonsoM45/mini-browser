These screen protectors are good if you want basic care of your screen. As in you just want it to keep your screen from having scratches and fingerprints. It isn't anything fancy, just a plain Jane screen protector. But it did fit well & if you know what your doing you shouldn't have bubbles. I would recommend this because of its price. It's well worth what you pay.
