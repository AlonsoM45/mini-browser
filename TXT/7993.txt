I bought this knife based on reviews I found on different forums and YouTube. Just google or search YouTube, you&#699;ll find a TON of information and reviews on this knife.  One of the best reviews is by Nutnfancy on YouTube.  Here&#699;s my thoughts:BLADE:AUS8 steel.  It&#699;s decent steel... Sharpens up easily, and keeps an edge.  It was extremely sharp out of the box, and I personally prefer FFG blades, so that was another plus for me.  Nice jimping on the top of the blade that helps with grip when cutting.  The thumb studs are solid.  When closed, the blade on my knife sits exactly centered.  NO blade-play whatsoever.  Up, down, left, right...it&#699;s solid.  The satin finish is nice.  I like how the RAT logo contrasts on the blade.  Very cool.  (I&#699;ve seen reviews on the black finish, and people are saying that it comes off way too easily, and really is there just for looks.  So I&#699;ve decided to stay away from it.) The blade has a nice belly, and is shaped for a lot of different utility tasks.  The blade shape and FFG is one of the main reasons I looked at this knife in the first place.  Well, that and the price.HANDLES:Another reviewer said these were G10.  I don&#699;t think so, and I don&#699;t remember what I read in the blade review forums...but I think it&#699;s Zytel or something.  But it feels like G10.  The finish is really nice on the handles.  The finger choil up front is deep, and it fits my finger in nicely.  It gives good solid control in hand.  It&#699;s not as grippy as my Spyderco Tenacious, but it&#699;s in that same style: sort of a smoothed out grip.  I&#699;m not sure how it will hold up covered in blood (I hunt wild boar) or even just water...that remains to be seen, but I don&#699;t think it will be a problem. (I&#699;ll update this review if it is) I really like the coyote color.  It complements the satin blade very nice.  IF it were G10 handles, the knife would be even MORE AWESOME.  But then again...the price on this knife would probably jump as well.BUILD:Well made. Torx screws hold it all together and the pillar/liner construction looks strong.  I don&#699;t mind that this knife is made overseas.  It&#699;s well done. (Good quality control in manufacturing) I know others have said this, and I agree...if Ontario would have skeletonized the steel liners, that could shave an ounce off the weight.  But the weight (5 oz I believe) is fine to me.  It doesn&#699;t feel that much more heavier than my Spyderco Tenacious in my pocket.CLIP:I like that the clip is 4 way adjustable.  Tip down, Tip up, left, right... you can set it up the way you want.  A definite plus. It&#699;s a long clip too and sits relatively deep in the pocket. The only thing I don&#699;t like is that black paint. I felt that a stainless clip would match the blade better. I&#699;ve seen pics and videos of this exact knife after a year or two of use...and the chipped black finish on the clip looks kinda cool... gives it that &#34;Boba Fet&#34; worn in battle tested look.  So it&#699;s not a deal breaker, and I think over time it&#699;s going to give this knife some personality. If I end up not liking that look...I&#699;ll just take the clip off and buff off the black finish myself.  Easy enough.EDC-ability:It&#699;s a little big for a TRUE EDC knife in my opinion.  But to me, a TRUE EDC blade would be a Kershaw OSO Sweet, or Spyderco Dragonfly, or something similarly sized. (Those are the two I own and carry as EDC, so they&#699;re my only comparisons) BUT, lately I&#699;ve been carrying larger sized blades: Spyderco Tenacious, SOG Flash 2, and now the RAT-1. I don&#699;t feel it&#699;s too big at all. I like that it&#699;s a little bigger, and my EDC blades become medium sized tactical folders. So, YES on the EDC-ability for ME.It was $40 dollars which is a little more than I wanted to pay, (I was hoping for around $30-35) but it&#699;s fine...I figured it was due to the demand for the coyote brown.  For the price...this knife is STILL a very good deal.  Regardless of it being made in Taiwan...it&#699;s well built.  It blows my mind that there are folks comparing this knife to other more expensive blades and complaining about the steel, or not being made in the US, or the lack of G10 scales...??!!  IF this knife were to be made that way...it would be MUCH more than $40 dollars!  So judge it for what it is.  It&#699;s a $40 dollar knife that will take whatever you throw at it.  AND it has a limited lifetime warranty.  Not bad for a budget folding knife made in Taiwan.  (And the plain black handle version can be bought right here on Amazon for $27 bucks!!!)If you&#699;re looking for a HIGH value, MID sized, LOW (to MID) priced, budget (IMO) folder...the Ontario RAT-1 fits that bill. It&#699;s well worth the price. 9 out of 10 for me.  *If the clip was stainless, and the liner skeletonized to drop weight...DEFINITE 10 at $40 bucks for the Coyote handles, and $27 for the black handles!!! Get one...!!!.
