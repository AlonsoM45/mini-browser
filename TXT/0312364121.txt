This is the best Kristen Hannah book out there....well right up there with Night Road and Mystic Lake and Fly Away.  This was my first and I guess the first one always stays in your mind.  Fly Away was probably one of the best as it takes place in modern day but Winter Garden flashes back to the war.  I bought it to be able to read it again and again.
