This book will take you on a very unusual journey through the mind of one of the most important people on human psychology in history - father of analytical psychology Carl Gustav Jung.The book that is not easy to read even though it supposed to be an autobiography. And it is, just most of the times it looks like an unusual biography and seems like it was written about the life within the author's mind. This book is my first meeting with C. G. Jung and I should admit that there were parts where I didn't understand exactly what he had in mind. Probably I will have to read it once more in a few years after I'll read more of his works. But I liked it, because it portrays very interesting personality, who spend all his life studying human psychology and basically creating most of today well know psychology works and practices. I am very interested in psychology and it's always very interesting to know the basics.What is interesting in this book, that you can be acquainted with both parts of Jung's life - his life events and his inner life, his mind and thoughts. Both parts are very interesting - his childhood, early years, school, studies, work as a psychiatrist, relationships, trips and so on. Another part is more difficult and as I mentioned above it's not so easy to perceive. Jung talks about his dreams, visions, reflections, that sometimes really seem very crazy. That's why this personality is so interesting to me.I believe you should be ready to read this book and probably you will have to read it couple of times in couple of year's period. If you are interested in human psychology, behavior and philosophical personalities, I believe you will like this book as well.I will finish my review with one of Jung's thoughts that caught my eye in the end: &#34;We become lonely not when we don't have close people, but when we can't share things with them that seems important to us or when we hold on the attitude that is not acceptable to others&#34;.
