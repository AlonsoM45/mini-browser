If the SF series we watch these days would leave this much for the audience to wonder, not to tell them everything that will happen in the cliche storyline in the pilot already, then I would say the good science-fiction is what we watch. &#34;After&#34; does just that, leave parts of the plot to the viewer and in the same time makes the show much more suspenseful and much more interesting than it would be if the same old cliche storyline is served over and over again.Acting in the first half of the pilot is great, further in the pilot some things are slightly illogical, (they all born on the same date ended on the same parking lot?) but in general this is very good pilot which by atmosphere reminds on the first (and so far the best) season of &#34;Walking dead&#34;. I would really like for the series to continue so that we can see what's hidden and what is that screenwriters left for us to discover.Recommend to all, but mostly to CW and SyFy screenwriters, because this is how you make an SF series and not that corn stuff we watch on those networks.
