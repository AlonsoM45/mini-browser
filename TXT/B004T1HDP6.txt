I bought this so there would be no more clutter on our fireplace, 8 sets of keys and mail, just gets to be too messy. So I decided to buy this even after reading some of the reviews. There is a small gap, but so far I haven't had anything fall through the gap. We have it hanging right next to the door and it looks great
