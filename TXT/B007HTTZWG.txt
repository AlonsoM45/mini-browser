I ordered the Sun Power like in the description and I received &#34;Natural&#34;. It was way too light of a shade for my skin tone and that's not what I wanted. I called Eileen at the house of beauty and she said she did not have that shade. She refunded my money but if your interested in the sun power she does not have it. Truly disappointed because I really wanted the Sun power not the natural.
