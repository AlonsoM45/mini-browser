I have received the Squeeze & Teethe Lamb from Infantino to facilitate my review.&#8221;My 2 month old son loves this lamb.  It is easy for him to grab and he smiles every time he sees it.  The soft material is perfect for him to suck on.  I am excited to see how he plays with the toy once he gets older.  This is his go to toy at playtime!
