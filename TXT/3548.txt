This costume worked better than expected.  The hat had to be &#34;de-wrinkled&#34; before use, but everything else was top notch.  Order this a few weeks before use.  when it arrives, expand the hat and fill it with a towel or something.  Let it set that way till the event.  Everything is made out of polyester but it is sewn pretty well.  I was able to use it, wash it, pack it away for use another time.  Everyone loved the costume and I was a great conversation starter.
