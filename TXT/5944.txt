With this collection, Nana's fourth book is yet another great source of insight into what goes on in the minds of the vast majority of Ghanaians in particular and Africans in general. The settings are drawn from multiple countries and cultures, but the thread that runs through is the same - we are able to laugh at ourselves in spite of the situations in which we find ourselves. Be prepared to laugh, smile, raise your eyebrows and shake your head at the same time; the mixture of humour against the backdrop of everyday reality is that potent.By the way, prepare to pull an all-nighter - this is one of those books you might find yourself quite unable to put down until you have read through right to the end. Nana has really spoken of Ghana indeed. Both thumbs up!
