I'm convinced that I received a knockoff. This is my 4th time purchasing an OtterBox product and I have never had this problem before. my last OtterBox lasted almost 2 years and during that time only one of the clasps broke. But with this case only two of the inside clasps are left and it's only been 3 weeks of usage, every time I'd go to unclasp it one of the clasps would break. I would never order from this particular seller again due to the fact.
