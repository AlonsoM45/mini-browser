This book was fascinating from the first chapter on.  Jacob pulls you in with his &#34;teen angst&#34;, and softens you up with his relationship with his grandfather.  It is full of unexpected twists and turns, and the photographs add an extra mystery to the whole plot line.  Want to see more from this author!
