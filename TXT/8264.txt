MAYBE this would work for the range, but I would never carry this for any reason. The first time that I used it the ball bearing that sits on top of the spring fell out and it no longer stays opened or closed... Its a piece of junk. I have used other speedloaders and own several now, but i would never buy another HKS and never another from Amazon, to many knock-off products lately.
