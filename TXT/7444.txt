I bought this not knowing how the juniors large would fit but its perfect!  I'm usually a woman's medium and this fit like it was made for me.  It's long enough where my butt isnt showing when i bend over.  The material is nice and a bit stretchy.  I bought the yellow and its a great spring/summer color.  I just ordered the teal color as well.  I cant wait for it to arrive.
