A highly known skylander in all of the skylander fans, Trigger Happy is back and better than ever in Series 2. You know, this tech-element skylander will never grow old around the world. He came in the Skylanders Spyro's Adventure starter pack ( along with Spyro and Gill Grunt). He still is rocking with his golden pistols and safes. His pistol and safe path are the same, but he has an awesome wow-pow power now. While using the golden machine gun, press the primary attack to fire out a mega blast.Even if you already have Series 1 Trigger Happy , you should buy this one to ( I'm not crazy people). Overall he is like the best one so far in the tech element ( my opinion). Leave comments or questions on Skylanders Giants
