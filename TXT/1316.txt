This book is terrifying and captivating and brilliant. I could not put it down. It made me hateful and angry and opened my eyes in a way that I cannot come back from. My entire understanding of myself and the world changed with this read. It is not for the faint of heart. If you are a feminist or believe in women or at the very least have any concept of human decency this will affect you. It affected me. I finished the book, looked up, and whole heartedly felt baffled by the fact that the world around me had not changed when I had changed so much. I highly recommend. It is a very unique look at very heavy subject matter.
