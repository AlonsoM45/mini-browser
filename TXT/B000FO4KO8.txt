I gave the ratin g of 5 stars for several reasons. First it is a good size for a portable player, and fits in your hands comfortably. Second is the fact that it will play the regular DS games as well as the ones for the DS Lite. It is the only model that will play games for made for more than one model. The only thing I don't like is that it will not play all the newer games, but you can't have everything. In closing this is a well made system, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun inexpensive handheld video game system.
