So far so good, my daughter loves it! It took me over a month to finally choose this convertible carseat. I was torn between this one and chicco. I do travel a lot, so after reading many reviews I really wanted safety as a priority (and Britax was it). It was pretty easy to install, looks and feels comfortable!
