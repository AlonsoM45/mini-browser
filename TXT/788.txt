This is not the first kindle book that i have purchased where the spelling errors and wrong word substituted has been dreadful.  Perhaps its just me, but I think the amount of typos in kindle books reflect the quality of the product delivered,as for the story - i have purchased book 4 - only because I like to finish a series once started.  It was a nice waste of time to read the series but i really started to be annoyed with the &#34;top of the tallest mountain&#34;, &#34;colder than the coldest night&#34;, &#34;bigger than any monster ever seen before&#34;.  For mine that is a cop-out on providing a meaningful description - and it is descriptions that keep the reader entertained.  The characters had potential however they never really strayed from being good, bad or hero.
