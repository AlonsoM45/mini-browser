I will start by saying that I have never replaced a garbage disposal before.  I was very unsure of what I was getting myself into.  I just knew that the 1/2hp Badger that was installed now had to go.  It was a 3 bolt style and I was looking at getting this and an adapter.  After reading some reviews, somebody had stated that everything that you need to install the Waste King L-2600 was in the box.  So I ordered the Waste King and some plumbers putty for good measure.  It arrived in 2 days in perfect condition.  I opened the box and looked at the contents.  I was instantly over whelmed.  I read the manual and realized that this was much easier than it looked.  I turned off the breaker for the disposal and started to remove it.  I disconnected the wiring from it and removed the pipe then turned it.  It came right out.  I removed an inner flange then pushed, the 3 bolt bracket was out.  I Cleaned up the sink, connected the E-Z connect flange for the Waste King, lifted the Waste King up and spun, it was in!!  I connected the drain pipe (had to cut an inch off it) easily.  Then I noticed the Waste King has a plug in power cord where as the old Badger was wired directly.  I went to Home Depot and got an easy connect plug for the wire and I was done.  I run the water and had no leaks.  Turned on the power and was amazed at how quite it was.  The one thing to note is the rubber guard that stops stuff from falling into the disposal on accident, also stops food.  This takes a bit of getting use to.Pros: Very easy to install and has everything you need.  Quiet and strong.Cons: Was not prepared for the plug in wire. (I know that is not really a con but I had nothing else bad to say.)
