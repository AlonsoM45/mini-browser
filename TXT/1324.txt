I wasn't expecting much when I ordered this ring.  My only expectation is that it won't turn my finger green.  I think it's safe to say I got a lot more than what I expected.  The ring is heavy for it's size but to me that speaks of the quality of the material.  The matte finish is really nice and I've yet to scratch it after about a week of wearing it.  The smooth shiny sections are a great compliment to the matte finish.  For this price, it's a steal and you cannot find a better ring for the same price.  I highly recommend this ring to anyone looking for something that not your traditional wedding band.  You will love it!
