A Fashion course mate showed me this book in French, and i instantly fell in love with these amazing drawings! Such a distinctive style, flawless details and strokes! I was so glad I found an English version! Of course it will next to impossible to reach the same level of illustrating, but it is a great inspiration, and I can always set it as a bench-mark for my development!Thank you Anna! Your book is a total treasure!
