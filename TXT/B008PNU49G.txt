Chains came well packaged with styrofoam to protect the blue chains from scratching. It also came with the masterlink that connected the link, and was a perfect length for my bike. I didn't need to use a chain cutter because it came with 96 links. Quality is great for the price I paid. Haven't had any problems with it.
