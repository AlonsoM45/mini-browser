I purchased the light grey hobo/handbag, however, it is not near the color I expected. More bronzie, however with that said, I do love the size and convience of it as I am trying to get away from such a large handbag, but yet one that will hold what I carry and this bag does just that, I will keep it and enjoy it, besides the color is growing on me even though it's not grey. tac
