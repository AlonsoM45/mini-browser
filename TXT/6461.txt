Overall I'm pretty happy with this coat. Past reviewers commented that the wool was scratchy, or low quality. Yes, it's scratchy, but not terrible. To be honest, when compared to other wool items that I have, it is pretty smooth. It has a smooth felted feel to it, which is perhaps why past reviewers didn't like it? (It isn't fuzzy soft, or lambswool - it's more like a &#34;motor coat&#34; kind of wool.) The quality is about what I expected for the price. The wool isn't super thick, which I appreciate, so the &#34;skirt&#34; of the coat drapes fairly well. It's warm, windproof, probably not the coat I'd want for sub-zero temperatures, but great for cool brisk November days in Oregon. I liked the studded sleeves better than I expected, they stand out more on the actual coat than they do in the photo, and they add a nice feminine touch. I love the gray color.  Now for the less than ideal... it's not quite as structured as I thought it would be, and it bunches up a little around the waist. The arms could be a little longer but I always have trouble getting coats with long enough arms. I'm 5'8 and ordered the small, but wonder if I should have gotten the extra small - the shoulders fit, but as I mentioned there is a little bunching of some extra fabric around the waist. That seems to always be the trade-off- enough room in the shoulders, or a nice tailored look around the middle. When all is said and done, this coat is a little bulkier than it looks in the photo, but I still like it. I'm keeping it, and in the few times I've worn it, I've gotten a lot of compliments.
