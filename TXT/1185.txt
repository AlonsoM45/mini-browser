It's pretty amazing considering this is the first laptop I have bought in five years. The startup is quick and smooth, the keyboard has large font and a non-slippery feel which is lovely, the touchpad responses well enough no sensitivity issues. I'm amazed by how quickly the programs open up and how efficient it moves from one program to the next.The weight isn't very heavy, its compact, the battery is easily removable and having a CD/DVD drive is a plus. Of course Windows 7 has an excellent interface I'm familiar with and its very user-friendly. Overall its a great product, I've had no problems after the first couple of days and the shipping was fast and the laptop was in mint condition no flaws as far as I could tell. Also the speakers are better than I was expecting it, it can get pretty loud and the screen is perfect for watching movies, great resolution.One of the best selling points about Toshiba is their extra applications such as the PC Health Monitor, which was a lifesaver on my last laptop it tells you basic info about the CPU temperature, fan speed, battery life status which is a simple way of monitoring the over health of your laptop and tracking its decline.I would say this laptop is best if you are looking for a device to keep up with your internet browsing, watching movies and listening to music and doing moderate use of applications such as MS Office etc. Excellent choice for a student!
