Tami Hoag does it again!!! From the first chapter to the very last word, The 9th Girl is another "can't put it down" "just one more chapter" great book. Like lots of her books, it can get graphic at times. Not overly so, but the reader definitely needs to be able to be able to picture the crime scene of a horribly murdered young girl. Also the autopsy, and the investigation of her, and other similar murders. For me, that's one of the things that makes her books so great!!!! She really brings the reader into the story. I'm not some sick and twisted serial killer, but, I love reading about them. Especially reading about the combination of the forensics and police work that help catch these people, and get them off the streets. Forensics fascinate me, and this book, has some of that, along with the thrill of the feeling that you're part of the investigation, while safely at home. It also talks about bullying and what it can lead to!!!! Also it shows how one person can make a difference by standing up against it!!!!! Great read!!!! Highly recommended it!!!!!
