OK so there are a lot of people who rag on Condor as "airsoft ONLY" equipment. I completely disagree. Yes, it&#699;s fine for airsoft.  But unless I was going to be deployed...this gear is good enough to do run and gun, or even in a WROL situation it would work fine.  It IS made in China, and yes, sometimes you&#699;re going to run into quality check issues, but for the most part, this rig works great.  And for the price...it earns 5 stars because it&#699;s worth it and then some.  And I know there are a lot of snobs who poke their noses up in the air in regards to Condor, but I have a number of pouches and other gear from them, and I personally think they&#699;re built strong.Now on to the review:I run this chest rig with a Condor rip away EMT bag on my left, and a Condor sidekick pouch on my right, both pouches on either side of the sewn in magazine pouch. I run 4 pistol mags with my flashlight and multitool positioned in the 2 middle pistol mag pouches.  While I can carry 6 AR mags in it, I usually carry 3. With all this gear on, it&#699;s still comfortable enough for all-day use (PLEASE...this is BATTLE GEAR. IT&#699;S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE FLEECE LINED, PARIS HILTON KINDA STUFF!!!) just be sure to set it up right. I&#699;m a big guy wearing a 2x shirt, and this fits me fine.  It would probably fit someone who wears a 3x or maybe even 4x.  (and if you&#699;re a 4x kinda guy...hit the stationary bike once in a while! Trust me, you&#699;ll thank me later.) The molle on this rig fits all of my gear fine, no problems there.  The stitching is heavy duty. Maybe not mil-spec, but heavy duty nonetheless. One thing I like about this rig is that I can put my Condor compact assult pack on my back, and I&#699;m good to go.  *YES...I have a LOT of Condor gear in this loadout but I also have Maxpedition as well as Camelbak equipment on other rigs.So, if you&#699;re being deployed...go with the best you can buy.  If you&#699;re just planning for the zombie apocalypse or run-n-gun training or competition, this will work fine, and you&#699;ll be happy you saved the money.One more thing on Condor:From what I&#699;ve seen and read, their quality has gone up tremendously in the last couple of years.  They&#699;re really making an honest effort to win our business with quality equipment that&#699;s made overseas.  And on top of that, they&#699;ve also started manufacturing some products here in the U.S.
