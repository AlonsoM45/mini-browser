Well I'm using it to review my purchase and it's really great, I had an ipad and for the price the ipad can do it all but this is a comparable alternative. My only negative mark would be the availability of any really cool or useful apps in the &#34;blackberry world&#34; they have all the basic must haves, it works well for the person on the go or Mr.business man, and the kid trying to show up his friends at school. You should definitely consider this tablet when shopping for one, it will surprise you.
