When I search strings like "statement command" it finds the phrase(4 cases exactly). However, the highlighted phrases are a few word off-focused. That is, in the following text snippet,'The Show Next Statement commmand...'"Show Next" is high-lighted instead "Statement command". In this case, two words are off-focused.Additionally, quite a few graphic titles like "Run to cursor", "Step Over" are hard to recognize.Lastly, I felt a couple of pages are missing although I don't remember exactly where they are.As a overall judgement, I don't regret buying this book. I'm reading this book on my Android smart-phone, too.Take care,
