Recorded in 2010, you'll find a few familiar rants and toons from his popular web series on this comedy album, but notably this fills in the gaps for the storyline of Germaine's nervous breakdown. I'm glad that JIM keeps it fresh by including Pillz-e and Begley (as I began to miss the squirrel punk Brit ex-pat- think Sid Vicious), in his never-ending NYC cultural/social commentary. He's ballsy as ever telling it like it is whether it's Germaine's weight gain, the state of education, or people walking around zombified from a cocktail of trends and antidepressants. Don't be afraid to DL this if you want to mirthlessly grin... or do be afraid.
