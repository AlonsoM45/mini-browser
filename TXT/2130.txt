Just received my Wright Pre-filled Syringe Carrying Case - Pack 2, and I must say it's a good idea, but the carrying case needs to be about a 1/8" longer to hold my syringe, which is filled with 50 units of insulin.  In the information, listed in fine print it does state that the case will hold up to 49 units, but the most insulin I could get into my syringe, and be able to fit inside the case was 48 units of insulin, again it's a good idea, but the case should be about an 1/8" longer to accommodate a full 50 unit syringe, again the information states that it fits my size syringe, and it does, but it will not accommodate the full length of my syringe when filled with insulin to it's full 50 units capacity, the case will only accommodate a syringe with up to 48 units of insulin.  I am thinking about drilling a small hole in the end of the carrying case, which then would allow me to fill my syringe to the full 50 units of insulin I need. I do recommend this Pre-filled Syringe Carrying Case, but it does need to be about 1/8" longer, so I can only give it a (3* Rating).Note: Update - I was using a BD 1/2 cc syringe which at full capacity holds 50 units of insulin, and it would not fit the case it was too long when full, so I upgraded to the next larger diameter syringe, a BD 1 cc capacity, and it holds my full 50 unites of insulin, and fit's the pen case without any problem.
