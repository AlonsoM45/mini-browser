This is very good quality for a costume. I love how bright and durable the fabric is. My only complaint is that the measurements--as said in previous comments--are geared more toward men or women with longer torsos. I have longer legs and a short torso, and I'll likely need to either have it adjusted or tie it around my waist in a Portal 2 style rather than wearing it normally. It fits perfectly otherwise, or else I would return it and size down. All in all a very good product, but it's a risk if you're not sure on what size you might need.
