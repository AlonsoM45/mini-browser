I am looking for something to make a nice, but easy bun. Unfortunately this is not it! I tried to use it am it snapped into pieces before is even got to try it out. I emailed the company about it before I wrote a review, they did say they would send me another one, but they never did. So I'm going to recommend this to NO ONE! Please buy one that actually haas a chance at working, this is just thin cheap plastic. Yes it is cheap enough I didn't ask for a refund, but they shouldn't sell something that doesn't work!
