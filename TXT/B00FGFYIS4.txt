I really enjoyed this book. It was funny as hell and surprisingly sweet. I might've even shed a tear or two.It wasn't the same old kidnapping book, this one was special, because I liked it and the characters weren't boring or always trying to hide their feelings from each other. It was action-packed with death-threats and sexual tension. It doesn't get much better than that.
