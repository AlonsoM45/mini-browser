Excellence! Weight forward design is aggressive. This hammer has its weaknesses,  but every hammer does. I've rarely needed another, nonspecialty, hammer to complete any given task. I prefer(as do most other experienced carpenters/contractors/handymen) to keep a spectrum of nail bars to back up all hammer use and I've found that this practice counters virtually every blind spot this hammer has. I'm extremely happy with this hammer.I actually bought this one to replace one like it that I'd somehow lost after about 10 years of heavy use. Demolition, finish, rough framing, chiseling, some engine work, fencing. I miss my lost one :'(
