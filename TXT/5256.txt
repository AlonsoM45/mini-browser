We bought this to use for a cross country trip (4 adults and a 4 month old). Worked GREAT!! Plenty of room and plenty of privacy. There was even room for the pack n play set up with 2 adults on one side of the tent with tons of room to spare. I loved being able to stand up in it too. I highly recommend this for families of all sizes and also for couples wanting a huge tent to spread out in. It's almost too big for just 2 people though.
