I got one from my mom and loved it. You can hold it with one finger. It closes tightly to slip in your bag, it fits in the car cup holder, it also is insulated so it doesnt sweat all over everything. But yes I dropped it while getting into my car and it broke, badly! I went back to order it from KMART and they no longer had them. I was sad, but I got the name off of my moms bottle and here it is. I love AMAZON! and am so glad I found my favorite bottle again.
