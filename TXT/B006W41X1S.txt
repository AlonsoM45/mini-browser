I love this product! It is absolutely perfect for what i use it for. But there are some minor problems but are barely noticeable if you're like me.The only problems I've encountered is a buzz in the left earphone but when i'm playing COD there is a lot of action and is not noticeable until the action dies down or until i'm in the pre-game lobby.The only other problem is when i go at-least 15 feet away from the receiver it cuts in and out of connection but again barely noticeable if you're actually playing the game.But overall i give this headset a 4 because of its pros.
