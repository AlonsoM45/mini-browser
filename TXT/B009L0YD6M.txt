First off, it shipped very quickly. The box was a little dented, but the bottle itself was perfect so I didn't really care. I quickly went to put it on. My nails look like diamonds now. It goes on perfectly, but everyone needs to remember/ realize that you dab glitter nail polish on for a first coat, then paint on a second coat. It makes for very uniform nails. I'm really satisfied with this purchase, and I'm actually relieved so see the comments that it chips off easily because I'm horrified at how difficult it is to remove glitter nail polish. Anyways, I would recommend this polish to anyone. It's fantastic.
