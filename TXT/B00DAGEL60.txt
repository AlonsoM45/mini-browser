The way the picture looks on the website, it looks like a bangle. Once received I saw that it was a small, itty bitty ring that I had no use for at all. Basically just gave my money away. I know next time I need to read very closely before purchasing anymore items. But I don't like the ring, it would not have been a choice I would have made hadI known it was a small baby ring.
