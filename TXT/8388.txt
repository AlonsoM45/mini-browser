I got tired of my mascara running when prepping food for guests.  These definitely do the trick.  If the fumes are really strong they can still burn my nose a bit, but overall these glasses have made chopping onions so much more enjoyable.  I tried all the other tricks...running under cold water, putting onions in the freezer shortly, or in the fridge etc.  None of them kept my eyes from watering except for these glasses!
