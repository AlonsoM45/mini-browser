I love the product, I was new to scrapbooking so I had no idea how expensive it would get to be just to get the basic sets.  However, I love that I can use many other company's products on it with the adapter set.  I found many many videos on the web for other companies products and how to use them but few on the fuse.  It's pretty simple to use however.  I'm handicapped so the weight tends to be a problem (IT&#34;S VERY VERY HEAVY!!!) but am working around it.  Several of the presses (butterfly, leaf, oval, etc.) are truly beautiful.  I'd sure recommend it, seems like each company has things to recommend theirs, but Fuse will give you the ability to use all their best stuff too so, how could you go wrong?
