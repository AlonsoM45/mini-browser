I was sceptic buying an used objekt over internett, and pay before I recieved the book, but was plesently surprised!!The book was in the perfect condidtion as described, and was delivered to me within the timeestimate:) Overall very pleased, I got a book in perfect (as new) condition, and shipping for less money than I would have to pay for an new book at my school:)
