This is a very useful app. I honestly have never been very good housekeeping track of my period, and honestly tend to lose track very easily. This very simple to use app has helped a lot.Unfortunately my son, played with my kindle and reset it to factory. I lost everything I had entered in the app. Hopefully it won't happen again. I hope having it connected to an email address will help prevent such a loss should it happen again.
