Being an herbalist, I have done some research on these ingredients.  Mostly good things, and a few bad.  However, I can say that my husband and I have not been this &#34;close&#34; in years!  Give this product a try.  Nothing works on everyone (those little blue pills didn't do much for my husband), but I would certainly recommend giving this a shot!
