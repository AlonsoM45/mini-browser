I really like this...its simple easy and its still compact enough with it being a wallet so that I can keep my cards and stuff in it if need be. One little thing...is that its not quite as snug around my iphone as i thought it would be. But it still holds it nicely! Its not a case for everyday use...in my life at least...i use it when making quick trips to the store...or going out to dinner or something with friends. Worth the price and i would buy it again :)
