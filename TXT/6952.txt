(5/10/13)Vendor purchased from:ArmyPropertyI've had this attached to my NcStar MOLLE/tactical vest(by VISM) for almost 3 weeks. I've no complaints about this product except for the securing system. The clips attach to the webbing perfectly, however, the straps that are supposed to secure it in place are constantly slipping which allows the carrier to sag below the comfort zone(wherever you prefer that it stays). I'm not military,  just a facilities maintenance person, but it seems that if I was carrying this all day and having to adjust it regularly in a combat zone or even in a security area,  I'd be a lot more annoyed than I am now being in an urban environment,  running from property to property, fixing, carrying, moving things. I plan on getting a heavy elastic strap and lacing it through the ends of the securing straps to see if that helps.06/20/13  The camo neoprene(or whatever it's made of) began pulling away from the top of the drink tube. My solution was to roll it away from the top to about half way, kind of like a woman's stocking, and then roll it back( I didn't let it form into a roll when pulling it back, but, made it slide down the length of the tube.)
