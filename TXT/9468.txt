very nice shoes, i had been buying cole haan dress shoes and kept having a problem with the soles. so I am giving these a try. They look and feel great, I am on my feet for long periods of time and these shoes are comfortable enough to wear during that time. I am looking forward to see how they hold up through the year. My experience with amazon has been very good , the shoes were half off and arrived quickly , thanks
