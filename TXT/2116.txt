I've had this toaster oven for about 6 mos. There's just two of us to cook for, so I use it quite often. I love the convection oven. Cooks things much faster and also browns them at the same time. Great for crispy potatoes. All four functions work well and love that you can remove the bottom pan to clean it. I've read in other reviews the complaints about the outside of the oven getting hot. I've never had a toaster oven that didn't get hot on the outside. And yes, the beeper is loud, but comes in handy if you're in another part of the house while something's cooking and you want to hear it when it's done. We've used the oven 4 or 5 times a week since we got it and haven't had any problems. We're very pleased with this product.
