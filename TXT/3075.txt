Love the look of the product, it can be very bright, but I like that part as well. I did turn the brightness down to the middle setting.  I sleep to one sound all night and then I have the Chimes set for my alarm and I LOVE that you can have two different sounds.  When I 1st set the alarm, it sounded as if it was going to turn on with high volume, but it doesn't. The Chimes start off on a low volume then slowly get louder.  The radio comes in nice and clear as well.I am very Happy with this product, I have and will suggest it to others!
