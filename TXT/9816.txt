Bought this for my girlfriend because it was on sale at the time, and she adores it. She loves the Garnet in the shape of a heart, and says the size surprised her,but loves how small it is,giving it a subtle feel to it,even with how complex the design is around the heart. She's worn it every day ever since. Came in undamaged and even sooner than the expected date. Overall a great purchase.
