I recommend this book to anyone who needs to understand difficult relationships with men.  Men have very fragile egos.  They can be damaged easily when they are children.  This translates into bad behavior in adult relationships.  As an executive director of a women's shelter I see the end results over and over.  I have ordered many copies for clients and advocates to read.
