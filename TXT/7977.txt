For what it is...it&#699;s 5 stars. Yes, it could be better by being linkable to other LED Pulse&#699;s, and I&#699;m sure there are 3 or 4 other ways it could be better...but then the price would go up and it would be a different animal. So, for what it IS...I LOVE it.With that being said, I bought the light because it was fairly inexpensive, and I wanted to see how it performed, and I&#699;m happy to say: it exceeded my expectations.  The LED&#699;s are much brighter than I expected, and this little (it&#699;s actually not THAT little) unit threw nice LED patterns across the hall, no problem. It covered a really large area.  The strobe function is just ok, nothing to write home about, but it&#699;s another effect built-in, and I like that feature alot.  I really wish it was linkable, but like I said above...it would be a different animal.  I think I might buy another unit, and set them up on the bottom of a T-bar, with my mega pixel LED across the top.  Perfect for a small to medium size venue.My gigs aren&#699;t huge where I need scanners or moving heads, but the Reflex Pulse gives the look and feel of a scanner.  If you&#699;re looking for an affordable alternative to a scanner effect, this is a good buy.  Also, I&#699;ve been reading online that Am.DJ is coming out with a linkable/DMX version...but some of those posts were from 2 years ago.  Either way, I&#699;m not sure they&#699;d make it under $150 bucks.If you have questions on it, post them.  I&#699;ll respond as best as I can.
