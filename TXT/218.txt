I have read over 60 zombie novels including zombie fallout, a new world, the remaining, and surviving the dead. I would have to say i enjoyed this one every bit as much as those. In fact in some ways more because this was not another series, it actually had and ending. I spent a long time scrolling thru ebooks looking for and new zombie read and honestly didn't expect much out of this book but was happy enough with it to write the first review i have ever done. As far as the mistakes or grammar problems, i was enjoying the story to much to really notice any. GREAT story cant wait for the next one.
