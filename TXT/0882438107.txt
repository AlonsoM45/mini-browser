I read the first volume, written about 50 years ago.  While I would have some differences in theology and approach, Hodges has written a classic!  Rereading this book was very helpful to me personally when I was looking at the time to finalize turning our ministry over to nationals and return to the USA.Robert PattonMissionary to Suriname
