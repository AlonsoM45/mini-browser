I have found this book extremely interesting from the point of view of total lack of knowledge of what actually went on in Africa at that time and the very difficult conditions encountered by those who chose to venture into such an inhospitable continent. As if the conditions were not enough to contend with there were also the natives with their requirements in order to pass through "their land". Sounds a bit like how things are today!!! Having said that I found it written in the very much journalistic form rather than as a novel. I now note this was the purpose of the writing in general.All in all a very good and enlightening read.
