I can definitely recommend Fall For Me with all 5 stars!  The characters really got inside my head, and I found myself thinking about them constantly throughout the day. I couldn't wait for work to finish so I could keep reading. I had to sneak in pages between emails and meetings. The writing is very descriptive, and throughout the story I could picture each scene like I was right there with the characters.  And the twist! Wow, what a twist! If you like your angels and vampires, Fall For Me is a ripper book for readers of all ages. Please write the next one fast!
