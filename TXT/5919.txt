I got these gloves primarily because I'm on the computer a lot and I live in the mountains. They are a tight knit so they do keep you warm; the quality of the sewing is high. The buttons are also solidly sewed on. They are very comfortable and pretty -- I've gotten a few compliments on them. Overall, I'd buy another pair just to have a variety of colors.
