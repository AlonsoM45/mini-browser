I've used this lightbox for ten years and it's made a huge difference in the quality of my life in the fall and winter. This is the box used in national research that proves the effectiveness of light therapyon depression and SADD. Lumens are important in a lightbox and this one is the best. The bulbs last a long time and I've only had to replace them once in ten years. If you're looking for quality, this is the one.
