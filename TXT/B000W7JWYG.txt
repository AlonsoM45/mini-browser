To anyone who has ever played The Settlers of Catan, you probably already have a decent understanding of how intense a game can be (especially when resources are tight). The extension (in my opinion) is even more fun to play than the standard 3-4 player game. I highly recommend this game set to anyone who is looking for an addicting board game.
