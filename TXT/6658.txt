Having heard about this tragedy before i also had many questions about how something like this could happen. When i saw the book i was drawn to read it. Reading Jackie's words and seeing the pain she went/ is going through made me realize to never take anything in life for granted. I cried through just about every chapter in this book. Its a tear jerker but once you pick it up you wont want to put it down
