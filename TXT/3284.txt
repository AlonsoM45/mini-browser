I was pleasantly astonished to find myself wanting to finish this book and also read the series. They do have the predictable story line but who doesn't want to end a book with a happily ever after.It has all the plus points of giving the reader exactly what they want to hear and feel.Making it worth a read. Melody Anne has definitely the kept me intrigued and wanting to finish the series!
