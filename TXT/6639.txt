This TV is awful.  I bought it on Amazon for during the lightning deals, so it was a good deal.  So we thought.  After 2 days of use, while watching the TV would just go bananas asking us to reconnect the wires.  We returned it and received a new set.  Same problem again, except now we had volume that would magically increase on its own.  Once again we exchanged it.  So now we are on our 3rd TV, the volume problem has happened twice in the past 2 weeks.  It's been a few days so we're hoping it will just stop.  Anyway, awful TV.  Waste of money.
