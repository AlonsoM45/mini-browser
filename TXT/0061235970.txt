Got it for my 3 year old son! yes I said son He saw it the library and loved it! Hes a big reader and ranges from superhero books to five little monkeys to fancy nancy. Its really good for young kids and He loves saying the fancy words and repeats them to his older cousins and it makes him feel superior! I love them! great buy and perfect size for smaller hands ( Not too big, not too small). Overall I am very pleased and recommend these books for young girls and boys!
