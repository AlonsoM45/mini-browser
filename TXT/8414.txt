While the book is compellingly entertaining from the start to the finish. It never really hits home on the issues it raises at the beginning. A disillusioned corporate sellout taking on the powers behind the world's biggest conspiracies should deliver so much more than this short piece did.Nonetheless, if youre after a strange, hilariously entertaining and at points depraved quickie, Eggman is your man.
