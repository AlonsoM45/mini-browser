I finished this book in a single sitting so I'ts not the biggest book around, but it was well worth the time and money I spent on it. I feel like the writing could have been a little stronger to make the &#34;intense&#34; moments a little more &#34;intense&#34;. That being said, there is some decent suspense. I feel like it could have been fleshed out to a couple hundred pages or so to make a full book. Maybe giving some back-story, and maybe flesh out the characters. But who knows, it's Dalglish, maybe after &#34;The Breaking World&#34; he'll make the backstory ;) Either way, another quality piece by Dalglish.
