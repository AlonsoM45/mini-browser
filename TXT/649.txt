Since the age of 14, this was my favorite Dickens novel. Having just reread it for the first time in probably 20 years, I  recognize the overt theatricality and floridness of the book, but accept those as part of its period. Dickensian truly captured the horror of the time. His characters, while certainly larger than life, are amazingly well drawn and colorful. I even found myself, once again, tearing up with Sydney Carton's final speech.
