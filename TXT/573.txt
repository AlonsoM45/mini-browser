We are warned not to judge a book by its cover, but in this case we get an accurate taste of things to come when we see the hooded hunter and the anxious yet calculating expression of the hunted.However, the cover must leave out a good deal, like the strange death of her father on his farm in Sheparton, the finding of a possible ally and lover, and the help that comes from an unlikely source.In rating a book by the difficulty of putting it down and by the quality of its prose, I give Play or Die five stars on each. The pace of the action, the ingenuity of the pursued and the glimpse of life in a post-apocalyptic world are blended to into a believable whole. Jo flees and misleads her Hunter while contriving to find opportunities for sleep in those three-hour periods of grace when her co-ordinates are not being broadcast. She has to survive for five days.
