I have to admit, if I wasn't such a patriot/conservative and very concerned about the path of our country, I wouldn't have continued reading this &#34;roughly&#34; written book.  That being said:  if you can get past the bad editing, I feel you do infact have a pretty accurate picture of what the USA will/could be if we don't reign in our current president.I would suggest reading this book to friends but let them know that leeway must be given due to poor/no editing.
