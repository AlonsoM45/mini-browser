This is a really great knife, as long as you know a good, experienced knife sharpener.Pros -This is a really solid knife all around, great handle, great balance and feel, not too heavy not too light, and comes with a nice sheath. Feels very durable and is very comforting to have while in the backyard at night.Cons -This knife came to me not as sharp as i would expect from Ka-Bar. It's sharp enough for daily use, but it aint cuttin no arm hair. Real deal knives are supposed to be able to shave hair. I will be taking this to a good sharpener as soon as i find one. Had to take a star off for this.
