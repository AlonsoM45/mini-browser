This is an attractive keyboard cover that fits very well and protects the keys as well as expected.  The problem is that the top row of keys - the half-height function keys - are mislabeled.  I don't use those keys very often so it's not a huge problem for me but that seems to be a very significant flaw in a keyboard cover.
