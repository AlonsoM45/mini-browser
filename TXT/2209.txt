Although this is a very pretty little dress the quality is very poor!  After one ware the cheap fabric frayed, snagged and showed signs of distress.  I washed it on gentle cycle in a lingerie bag and dried on gentle cycle, and it fell apart.  Many parts of this outfit is glued and not sewn together.  As the glue melted in the drier it stuck to different parts of the dress leaving glue spots everywhere.  I would NOT recommend this product nor purchase from this company again.
