I purchased this 2-Day Fast Formula, Vanilla Flavor, from Amazon seller Beachbody, which turned out to be a major scam.This item had zero effect except that it causes severe constipation.Beachbody should re-evaluate whether to market this product in the future.I will be posting this review in various places on the internet in hopes of spreading the truth about Beachbody and this scam of a product.
