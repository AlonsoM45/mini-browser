I love this necklace becausr it's a simply cross that you can wear with anything ! I also keep getting good complements on it. But the only bad thing about this necklace is that it broke a week after I had start wearing it. I was just sitting there doing nothing and it just fell of my neck out of the blue. And the part that broke was the main peice you us to connect it. Now it is just harder to connect it in the back, but I deal with it because I love the cross.
