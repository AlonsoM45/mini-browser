This is a thinking person's movie. It is experiential as well as cerebral. I dont know if I'll ever understand all of it and thats ok. It might be intended to be that way.It is hard to imagine how the actors, writers and directors accomplished this.  All deserve high praise. Roger Ebert gave it 4 out of 4 stars and watched it three times, which is exactly what I'm going to do. If not 4 or 5 times.
