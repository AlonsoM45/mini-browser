I first saw these shoes in royal blue at Nordstroms, fell in love but was nervous to spend that much on shoes. Wanted to avoid an impulse buy I may regret later. I have thought about these shoes for over a year, saw them on amazon and my husband encouraged me to buy them. I am a 7 1/2 and got an 8 just in case these ran small like many designer shoes do.They arrived in the designer box with all of the material to ensure they shipped in perfect condition. Picture does not do justice, they are spectacular. They are a bit difficult to put on because of the tiny buckle and the holes in the strap were not quite wide enough for the pointy thing in the buckle, I forced it in and it was fine. The size 8 I ordered fit my 7 1/2 feet perfectly. The shoes look like jewelry and so versatile they work for business and evening.I did an all day event in Manhattan in these shoes and was surprised my feet were not overly sore like they usually are after 12 hours or so. There is a bit of a cushion for the ball of your foot, if I had foot petals in these I bet I would not have been sore at all. Going to dinner or an event on your feet for a few hours is extremely doable in these and they look fabulous, lots of compliments from men and women. I highly recommend them, just buy one half size bigger than you are.
