Cherie Priest has mastered that fine line between vernacular wit and sophomoric daily diary sort of stuff.  In other words, she writes the way people talk, but not only that, she writes the way SMART people talk, and manages not to write any of the stuff you're going to want to skip.  I was a fan from the first page I read (which was in her first book in this series, "Bloodshot"), and hope this turns out to be a long series.
