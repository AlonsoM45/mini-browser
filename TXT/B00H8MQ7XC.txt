It was simple to assemble and light weight. The only down fall: you have to be careful in how you pack it in the vehicle or where you put it (I thought I was careful), but when it came to taking it out for use (the back part of where the baby sits) curved in (toward the back of my baby) and so did the flap at the bottom of the stroller (where things are stored), also the storage at the bottom (it's hard to fit anything in there. I don't leave it in my vehicle (so it couldn't have been because of the Texas heat). But other than this, I like the stroller. Since there were no reviews when I bought this, I took my chances... If I can go back, I would have bought another one that I was looking into.
