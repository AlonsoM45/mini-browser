We ordered this and got it really fast, but it was in pieces when it arrived.  Probably got damaged during shipping.  We contacted the seller, who was really great.  They immediately shipped a new one.  New one arrived really fast and not damaged.  A few days after we got it, it was broken.  It seems like a cheap product that isn't very durable.
