I bought two of these and I love them! I bake meatloaf and bread and basically everything I can think of in these pans. I make supper for two people so these are the perfect size. And I can wash them with my dishrag and don't have to scrub and scrub to get them clean. Defiantly nonstick and I will be buying more of Faberware Bakeware. Just love it.
