Great headphones, I've had many pairs, all in ear, including Shure se210, Brainwav M3's, Razer Moray+ and Klipsch S4's. These easily have the best and sharpest bass even when used with an amplifier. Hip hop and rap music is my main preference so these did a great job at delivering the abundant bass.Highs and lows are nice so good sound overall. I would recommend these to anyone looking for high bass and a good mid range price. Headphones themselves were a sturdy build and an interesting fit with one part of fitting in the cup of your ear while the other goes into the canal. Also came with a small origami crane and a letter from the sender. The Japanese make quality audio wear, which is what led  me to buy these in the first place. Very satisfied, 5/5.
