I heartily recommend this book to health care providers working with the chronically ill, as well as faculty preparing providers to work with people living with chronic illness. In a world with myriad definitions of "health" and "healing", chronic illness cannot be fixed with medicine or surgery. Using a mix of personal stories and simple truths, Ms. Amsden's thoughtful and engaging book proposes a new way of looking at our lives, and our journeys. Medicine absolutely plays an important role, and it is most effective when people can approach it with a positive outlook. Share this book with your students. Share this book with each of your patients. Wherever life finds us, this elegant collection of stories prepares us for true healing.
