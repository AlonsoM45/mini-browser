A fantastic looking watch that is nicely weighted. its not too light like some other cheaper watches.If your thinking about buying this watch go ahead as you wont be dissapointed.  I have had many comments on the watch, one workmate asked if it was a Rolex as it looks that good.Like other comments, the face is slightly darker than shown but I prefer that as it looks more sofisticated.  But to be honest most US based on-line web sites seem to be over brightning adverts these days.Thanks Bulova!
