The Devil Makes Three is a beautiful amalgamation of everything that is blues, ragtime, and bluegrass. The incorporation of the can mic added a a great feeling to the vocals in many of the tracks. But the retraction back to their outlaw roots with songs like Stranger, Hallelu, and Spinning like a top bring the album back to what I wanted them to sound like ever since their self titled album.I will love these guys to the end of the earth. They are everything I love about music at it's core. The raw simplicity compared to modern music and the mix of old timee sound with relevant lyrics makes for a great combination.
