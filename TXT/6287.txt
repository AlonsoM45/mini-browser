My only negative is that it moves so slow. The purchasing of the items and then having to wait so long for completion. I really like that it offers opportunity to earn the coins, so many games only offer the purchase of them, so that is a big plus. So if you make any improvements based on reviews I hope to see faster turn around on the game. :)
