Making every experience count, learning patience, accessing our incredible strengths and finding the humor in the daunting tasks of life are few of the lessons I am learning from Being My Mom's Mom. TRULY it is a guide book for those who find themselves on this journey of elder family care. There are books and seminars and classes and brochures, but NONE more human and heart-warming than Being My Mom's Mom. This is life and HOW we deal with our paths truly determines our destination.Loretta sits down with us, makes us cry, self-examine and laugh. Like the warmth of the most awesome cup of tea, she chronicles how she has chosen this path of dealing with Dementia all the while challenging us to see life's rolelrcoaster through a different lens and re-value the seemingly mundane.Read it once to cry and laugh, once to help remember the lessons in pain and once to highlight all of the wonderful gems of wisdom she shares. Expect to learn about and embrace....change.
