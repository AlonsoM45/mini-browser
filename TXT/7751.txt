I did alot of research on this unit and others before I made the purchase and what I found out is alot of ppl install it them selves rather than getting it installed professionally. So those ppl had alot of problems with different things. Since I saved money on the unit I paid best buy to intall it.  So far I've had no problems with it. Everything works great!!
