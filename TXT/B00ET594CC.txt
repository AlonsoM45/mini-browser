A simple book with tasty recipes. I'm not sure about it lasting 7 days because I've not tried it but I plan on it soon. What a great idea very simple. Although a mason jar is all that is suggested I still being a bowl to dump the contents. For the size I make the jar get cumbersome eat out of. Great salad recipes. Thanks.
