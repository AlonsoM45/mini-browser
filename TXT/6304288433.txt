But then again, it came in time for Halloween.  I love H2 (1981) and this package delivers.  It has a gang of xtras and a filmed episode of Horror hound's hallowed grounds (Halloween 2) for those that reads horror hound mag which is awesome.  The tv cut is cool but its edited!  That's what I thought at first but then my friend said it wasn't edited just added footage and whatnot.  So i got my hopes up for the tv cut being extra sweet but it is wht it is, a tv cut.  Nevertheless, it still brings back memories of watching it on television.  A must own for horror hounds and Michael Myers enthusiasts!
