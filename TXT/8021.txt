If you like doing nail art, this is a great book! It doesn't have any tutorials, but if you know basic nail art tricks, you can easily recreate the pictures. The designs range from classy and elegant to fun and colorful. This book is a great resource when you're not really sure what you want to do with your nails! I really love it!
