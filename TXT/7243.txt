Stephany Tullis has created a vibrant read with well-drawn characters that we've all seen in our respective houses of worship! It's refreshing to read a work that shows how faith links the Master's plan to the master plan described in the novel, and the big reveal at the end was worth waiting for. I'm looking forward to the sequel to see just what happens to Pastor Woody and the flock!
