My Frabosk plate worked OK for a while, but after a few month it started to do some crack-like noises.Then it lost its flatness, and assumed a curbed shape.Finally its three metal layers started to come visibly apart.In the long run, you may spend less and have far better results, buying a few induction pots and pans at IKEA.
