Well, what can I say really?  I bought a cord for my Dreamcast prior to these, and I wasn't happy with the results.  The RF adapter still works, however the one I had, not so good.  Every time I played a game the screen would have fuzzy hair moving up and down.  It discredited the Dreamcast's graphic ability since the first day I used that RF adapter.  Before I bought the AV cable, I tried researching ways to make the Dreamcast look even greater on HD TV.  The answer for that would either be the AV cable or a different adapter.  It's easy enough to look up online, but this baby here works just fine.  Not only does everything look great, but it came through the mail in a timely matter.  I have no quarrels over this product at all.  It's easy to hook up, and it'll go to practically any new tv.
