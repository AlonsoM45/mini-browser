This product overall is a good purchase, but like all things have pros and cons.The first thing I noticed when I received the used Galaxy Player I bought was that it was 100% out of battery. This was easily fixable when I plugged in the charge to recharge it but it was a little disappointing. When I turned it on later it worked well and started to explore. I was happy at the empty music library, fresh cleared screens ready for apps to be downloaded, and storage galore! However, all of the last user's personal pictures and videos were still on the device. For the sake of their privacy I deleted everything as soon as I could. Other than that, I can say that I am very content with the Samsung 4-Inch Galaxy Player! My weeks of researching a good media player paid off.Pros and Cons:Pro:- A camera on the front and back- Plenty of room for music and downloads- Access to many free apps- Easily fits in pockets or bags- You can plug in headphones to listen to music individually or use the speakers on the back of the Galaxy Player to share with others-  As I've heard previously stated, it's like a smart phone without the phoneCons:- The screen occasionally dims on its own even when being actively used- Sometimes the music is choppy when there are other applications open at the same time- The background of my screen has blacked out once and I had to re-start the Galaxy Player to reset itHonestly, I would like to say that the positive outweighs the bad. I bought a used one so perhaps someone who bought theirs new would have a little better luck. Overall, this is worth its bargain and I would recommend it to someone looking for a new media player.
