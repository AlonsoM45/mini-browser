While the description of this product clearly states that it fits the Kindle Paperwhite, etc. the labeling from Kate Spade, the manufacturer, states otherwise.I know this because it says so inside the cover "This case is made for the Kindle Fire only. enjoy!"I assume that's why the review written before me also complains that the cover is too big for their Kindle.Amazon has opened a "research case" in reference to the mixup since I called customer service.It is a very cute cover and seems very well made, unfortunately if you order it for anything but the Kindle Fire, you will be disappointed.  That is the only reason I gave this one star.  Otherwise, it seems great!
