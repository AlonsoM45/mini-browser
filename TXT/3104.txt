I loved this bag! It looks really nice on the inside and has many pockets. now i have to say it is smaller than what i had though, actually a lot smaller. I was going to use it as a fashionable diaper bag but it was to small so now i have a new purse! It is super cute and im way happy with it-that was my old review from when I first got it. After I had it for a few weeks it started falling apart. The snaps came off and one handle totally broke off. It just kept falling apart so I stopped using it
