I haven't, of course, read the whole book -- I mean, after all, it is a devotional with 52 entries, so I assume the author expects you to read one a week for a year. But I have read several, all in one sitting -- I couldn't stop myself -- and I intend to dip back into this regularly (maybe weekly, maybe more often). It's a very accessible devotional, and not something you have to work at to read.That doesn't mean I consider it fluffy or frothy -- far from it. Rose Chandler Johnson covers a wide range of topics and bases each devotional entry on a Scripture passage. The passages she chooses are from all over the Old and New Testaments; they are mostly well-known verses, but she manages to bring a fresh perspective to them. She is able to be profound without becoming pedantic or obtuse -- and that is a hard balance to maintain.This would be a great devotional for a new Christian, but even the more seasoned believer will get a lot out of it, despite the fact that it is intentionally light reading. Have you ever read a devotional early in the morning, and just couldn't follow it because the text was too plodding? You won't have that problem with this devotional, but you will still be challenged by it.
