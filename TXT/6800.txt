If you were kind of feeling a little iffy about the character of Thren Felhorn, (Haern's father) and why he was so ruthless and kind of &#34;off&#34;, this'll clear it right up, it's short, easy to read, and memorable. Dalglish managed to pack a lot of awesome into a little novella. Worth the time and money for any fan of Dalglish, (especially) or just someone looking for a good way to pass a little time.
