I fell in love with this series right from the beginning - the Men are hot and sexy and the ladies are loveable - BUT this book - WOW!!! all I can say is WOW!! Jarod is beyond hot and Sexy and Ce Ce - well you just can't help but love and admire her!  Wendy hit it out of the ball park with this book.  From the moment I read the first line to the very end of the book I was captivated and intrigued.  I was torn because I couldn't wait to find out what direction the book was taking but sad that it had to end.  You fall so easily into the book - totally worth the read !!!
