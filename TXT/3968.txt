In my opinion Mag lights of any model are the best flash lights made. I was a police officer for 17 years and recharable Mag lights were all we used. I carried a mini mag on my duty belt for back up, It's very bright for such a small light, the adjutable beam  is great, standard with all Mag lights. It comes with a spare bulb in the end cap and Duracell batteries.Ready to go right out of the package. I priced the same light, including the holster, at Home Depot, they wanted $22. Just a great light for a great price.
