Exceptionally well written, was intense, action packed. Amazonian meets tomb raider along with a punch of love story which will get any women's toes curling. Dark prince was indeep was a page turner,finished it in a day and half all the while dying with anxiousness . Hoping this new twist in the end will only make the series much more exceptional. Well done Kresley Cole
