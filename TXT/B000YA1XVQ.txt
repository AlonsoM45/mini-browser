Beware. Don't make the Fujistu mistake I did. I now own $2,500 worth of Fujistu-scanner-bricks.Fujitsu sells these expensive business-class scanners, then fails to update drivers for new versions of Windows.  When this happens, your scanner hardware will work fine, but your computer won't recognize it. I guess for a few hundred bucks I could live with this, but when prices get north of $1,000, I feel cheated.Buy this machine, and you may well be shopping for a new scanner before you've depreciated the first one.
