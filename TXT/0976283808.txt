I really enjoyed reading this book. It was so real of what goes on now a days and the reality of life when you choose to go down the wrong path only to realize you can do right if you want it or not. I hope there is another part to this story because it seems like there could be a second book. Again really enjoyed the book and I would recommend this book to others if they like romance, hardship, and just a dose of real life crap that happends in the world.
