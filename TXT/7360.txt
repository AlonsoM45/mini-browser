This charger definitely works for the HP Dv5-1235dx. I've been using it for about 7 months now and I have not once experienced a  problem with it. At first it seemed as if it wasn't going to work but after couple tries and changes of outlets it started working. now it works on all of them. over all really cheap charger and it does the same thing as the HP replacement. I spent more than $100 buying directly from HP and the charger burned out exactly after a year. so I kept searching til I found this on amazon, found a lot of other ones as well but I decided to give this one a try. I'm happy I did, No complaints, got it in 3 business days, works great.If they sell a back up battery for HP too I'd buy that too, good customer service over all.
