It use this for my X-T1 and two lenses, cleaning kit, batteries, charger, and still have room for any miscellaneous items that get handed to me while we are out.  It is a little on the big side for me but I like it.  The material is canvas and feels very well made.  The straps on the front are buttons.  The strap is nice and wide so it does not dig into your shoulder.  I am very happy with this bag.
