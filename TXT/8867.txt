I'm not sure why anyone would be complaining about the fitment.. I have a 5 year old pair of Oakley's and these things fit better than ones from Oakley.. You gotta make sure you put them in correctly.. There not easy to snap all the way in.. These things are awesome!! Thanks to the seller for selling quality at more than half the price!!
