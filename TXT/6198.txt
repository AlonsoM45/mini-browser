I bought this stick was in a pinch and on a budget,i honestly am not all that pleased with the button lay out the HAT switch is off set and at least for me feels awkward.The stick is very comfortable very nice grip feel.The buttons on the base a virtually flush with the surface of the base and that means you have to look down to find them taking your eyes off the screen,anyone who flys  combat simulation knows thats NOT ideal.
