A great read!  Once you start this book, you cannot put it down.  David's strength is developing his characters into real life people whom you can actually visualize and understand. You'll have your favorite character - I have mine.  You can see the countryside, the small town, the river, the people and you can smell the smells, taste the food and get into the very thick of the plot.
