I really wanted to stop using Quicken Essentials.  I was a Quicken 2007 user and as many of you know that came to an end with the Intel chip.  I liked the ability to track investments and other features and Essentials is a really dumbed down version.  With iBank 5 you view your investments using reports.  Awkward in my opinion.  It does a nice job of bringing in ALL my financial info, something that Essentials doesn't do.  I'm updating over 15 accounts.  That said, it takes forever to do this process in iBank.  If you want this to be automatic, prepare to pay for a yearly subscription to IGG Software's Direct Access ($40) or monthly ($5) on top of the $60 you shelled out for the iBank 5 program.  This should be free and part of the program in my opinion.  You can download files from banks and upload them for free but this takes too much time.  The user can't change many view options.  You're stuck with a check book view, 2 lines and taking up way to much screen.  Save your money.
