I LOVE THIS PHONE! HOWEVER, AFTER HAVING IT FOR 2 WEEKS IT SHUT DOWN! :( BUT, I DO WANT PPL TO KNOW I BOUGHT THIS REFURBISHED, SO DOUBT THE BRAND NEW ONES DO THIS? IT SUCKS BECAUSE I'M A SINGLE MOM OF A DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED SON WHO IS ALSO A TECHY! SO I AM PRAYING THE SELLER CAN MAKE IT RIGHT. WILL BE POSTING WHAT HAPPENS ASAP! :( ANYBODY READING THIS WHO PRAYS, PLS ADD THIS TO YOUR PRAYER LIST! I CAN'T EVEN AFFORD ANOTHER PHONE AND NEED A PHONE ASAP FOR MY SON'S MEDICAL, THERAPEUTIC NEEDS. EVERYTHING ELSE I've ordered from Amazon has been AWESOME! :)
