I bought and liked two similar Fujitsu scanners, about $2,500 worth, and used them in my business. They worked fine. Then Windows updated from XP, and Fujitsu has not updated drivers for either of these devices for any newer system.I now own $2,500 worth of plastic Fujitsu bricks.So, buy a Fujistu scanner if you must--and be sure you get all your scanning in before MS comes out with a new version of Windows.
