This may be the greatest external hard drive case ive owned. And ive owned a few. It fits very well in the pocket and is smooth on the outside. The cable that comes with it is big and fat too witch is good for stress/tension. The case is also very well designed, both sides pop off at the touch of a button, although you will need some good thumbnails to press the button all the way down. Then you can take any 2.5' Hard Drive and slide it in, pop the two sides back on and your ready to go.The only con i can think of, is what makes this design work. The SATA connector is a bit flimsy, and feels like it can be broken off, but it has to be like this so it can move at an angle to connect to the hard drive when you slide it in. If it wasn't flimsy, you would break it before you got a hard drive in it. So as a precaution, be careful when you insert or remove a hard drive.
