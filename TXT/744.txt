I bought this so we wouldn't keep breaking our Corelle dinner plates. We usually make our bacon in the microwave, it's a lot faster and easier. I use paper towels with this, two on the bottom and one on top, just like I always do. I like it but I don't think it does anything special. It is very easy to clean, with the paper towels it hardly even gets greasy. I will use it for a few months and update again.
