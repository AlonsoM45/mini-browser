These keyblade pendants are just breathtaking! The ones I received are exactly like the picture except the velvet in my box was red. The box came in fairly decent condition, but the pendants were in perfect shape and they're a good size. I couldn't even see the cast-line for them and all of them seem pretty sturdy to me. You do need to get loops for them because the keyhole (XD) is pretty small, and even if you did find a small chain, they would hang sideways. Even with the task of having to buy loops for them, I think these are still very much worth their price. I've worn all of them once but Diamond Dust, Three Wishes and Oathkeeper (Only because I associate certain days and moods with them and haven't gotten around to those yet). Oh, Spellbinder is the wrong color as shown, it's supposed to be blue, but I actually like it better in red. It almost reminds me of Halloween Town.So overall, these are pretty amazing. I'm often so captivated by them that I just sit and look at them.  I love Kingdom Hearts, so these were a must, but they're still &#34;pretty pendants&#34; according to my friends who haven't played any games in the series. The keyblades are high-quality, a brilliant silver color (okay, Spellbinder is red and silver),  and to die for! Where else do you think you'll find something like this? Go ahead and buy them, you know you want to! You've got to step forward to realize this wish!
