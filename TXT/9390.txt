This toy was the least favorite of the toys that my child received for Christmas. In theory this is a great idea, but in reality they are kind of limiting. If you like blocks like we do, then it is a fun &#34;extra&#34; to have in your block collection. But if your funds are limited, just get a really good block set with lots of blocks. Your kids will then have no limits. Or try Keva planks.....those are way cool!
