The pie dish is a little big when i saw it the first time. Because of the size I didn't use it to make pies. Instead, I've used it to make baked shrimp and roast chicken! So far so good. The color is pretty too!*****I feel that the dotted rim makes it a little hard to clean after roasting chicken in it**** My solution is to put aluminum foil around the rim PRIOR to putting anything in the pan. This way when it's time to clean up, simply remove the foil and then u don't have to do any work on the rim!Side note, stoneware cools down much faster than cast iron. So don't expect your food to remain hot 30 min after it's out of the oven. I have a le creuset cast iron and food remains hot after an hour outside the oven!
