THIS IS ONE OF MY HUSBANDS FAVORITE MOVIES...HE WAS IN THE MILITARY AND WAS A FRIEND OF TED KENNEDY, BROTHER TO JFK.WE HAD THE MOVIE ON VHS, HE FELL ASLEEP AND LEFT THE VIDEO IN THE VCR OVERNIGHT, AND IT SORT OF MELTED.  WE HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR THE DVD JUST ABOUT EVERYWHERE.  WE FINALLY FOUND IT ON AMAZON.  THEY HAVE GREAT SERVICE...WE RECEIVED THE VIDEO IN 3 DAYS AND MY HUSBAND IS HAPPY AS A PIG IN POOP.
