My husband and I don't normally order things on-line, but when I seen this Bible and the price, I knew I wanted it for our oldest son. I was surprised when we opened the package (which arrived way earlier than expected, another plus) that it was exactly how it was described on-line. We were certainly pleased with our order and will definitely order again.
