Wow. I usually don't like this type of book but when I started this book it surprised me I had to keep reading I had to find out what happened next. For a new writer she definitely has a way with her skills. This was a great book not to be past by. I only found one thing I didn't like and that was that it was way to short. ( I was gifted this book for a honest review.)
