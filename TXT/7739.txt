I have always consider myself politically of the mind of W.E.B. Du Bois but after reading this book I had a deep look into the soul of Du Bois and what makes him tic.  He was a DEEP intellectual who I feel felt like he could never truly be understood by his peer because I don't believe he felt anyone his equal.
