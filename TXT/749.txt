I don't usually take the time to write reviews on books, but on this one I had to make an exception. I absolutely loved this book. It was different and very interesting. I can't really find the words to describe the way I feel about this book, but this is kinda the way I felt about this book, it wasn't the best book I have ever read, but I couldn't seem to stop reading. If I had a minute at work I would be reading, and every other minute I had free I would be reading it. I would absolutely recommend this book to everybody, I don't agree with the one star ratings, yes at times the writer should have explained better, but that is why you have an imagination. It was such a good plot that I didn't mind having to use my imagination at times.
