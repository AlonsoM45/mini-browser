The speed button on the remote.I really love this fan. It is extremely quiet while still putting out a great amount of air movement. I love that it has 5 speed settings. I love that it has a remote. However, right out of the box, the remote will only control power and timer, but the speed button (to me, one of the most important functions because it is used in our bedroom) will not work. It boggles my mind that the other two buttons work, but the speed button will not. I'm not sure who I should contact about this issue, or if it is even covered by the warranty. Anyway, I still love the fan. Having a black fan goes so much better with decor than a white one and helps conceal dust that fans are bound to collect.
