This is by far the best 7" tablet /e reader I have owned or used. It does so much and moves so fast and smooth it is a true pleasure to use. The screen is incredibly clear. The e reader is much easier to see than other tablet/readers. The text to speech function is a real plus.It is so nice when you have to set it down and it reads to you while you do other things around the house. I love that I can cook, do dishes, fold laundry etc, and still enjoy my book! As far as I know this is the only tablet that has this function and in this price range you can absolutely do no better. There are some tablets that are selling for considerably more and do not do as much or work as well as the Kindle fire. Save your money and jump on this tablet. You won't be sorry.
