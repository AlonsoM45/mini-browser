This case is very thin and adds no bulk to your nexus 4, it does a good job raising the sides of the case so the screen doesn't touch the floor flat.One thing I wish they would add is the top and bottom of the case. If the case covered all around the nexus that would add protection which I would definetly buyvagain if improved
