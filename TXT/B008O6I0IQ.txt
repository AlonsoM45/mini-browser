I am pleased that my case arrived fairly quick, but not too pleased with the look of it.The product preview depicts a more realistic looking stitch, with a dark aqua blue belly and eyes, maroon colored nose and feet, and eyes going into the edges of the case.Here's a picture of how mine looked.[IMG][...]As you can see, my colors are way off, and it looks more cartoon-y.Still pleased, but disappointed at the same time.
