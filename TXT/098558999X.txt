Ooooh how I've missed these characters! Faith, Harmony, Krista, Carson, Maryah, Nathan,... I've been waiting for so long to know how your story would go on! And know I know, and I want to know what happens next!The writing was as good as it was in the first book, maybe even better. Karen Hooper is one of those really talented writers who can hook me to a book and let me stay up late because I just can't stop reading. I really love her and I love this series. It's so awesome! In this book we get to know a little more and we get to know new characters. There's action, romance, friendship, drama,... It's all there. And I still want to know more. Why did Maryah erase? That's the main question. Some of the questions are answered in this book, but most of aren't, which is good, because it makes me, as a reader, curious for more.What's also awesome, is that you can choose in this book! You want a cliffhanger? Or rather not? You can choose in this book! (Just read it and you'll understand.) I do recommend reading the first book before this one, because it starts right where the last one left off and you won't understand a thing in this book. There's no recap here. (So more time for the story to get on! Yay!) But since these books are awesome, it won't be time wasted.I know this review is not very long, but I can't say much else without spoiling the whole thing. So I'll leave it at this, but I do have one more question that has been burning in my mind since I read the first book... Where can I get my own Nathan???
