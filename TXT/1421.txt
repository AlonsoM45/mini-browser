So far...so good with this new Melitta coffeemaker. I've used it every day since it arrived. I looked and researched all types and makes and finally decided to get this one based on the previous reviews and past experience with Melitta products. In the past my luck with new coffeemakers has not been very good so I was really reluctant to even buy another one. Hopefully this machine will continue to be a solid purchase.
