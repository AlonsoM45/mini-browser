The board, bank notes and cards are very nicely decorated with the Yellow submarine film's characters/scenes. The only thing I don't like much is that &#34;houses&#34; and &#34;hotels&#34; are named &#34;friends&#34; and &#34;submarines&#34; but the plastic figures are still the same classic houses and hotels. It would have been great if &#34;submarines&#34; were actually yellow submarines.
