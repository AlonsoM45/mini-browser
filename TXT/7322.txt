i like this phone..Not alot to complain about except the lack of directions given with the phone.basicaly they cover how to get started on the phone...but not things like how to move and store things like pics from text messages oe multimedia messages. I still cant get my blue tooth to connect with this model phone and there is no trouble shooting for this in the manual either.i have a plantronic bluetooth.  The apps were easy to dwnload although i dont have a need for all of them....This phone clearly was made for people that have a wrking knowledge of android phones and their apps.
