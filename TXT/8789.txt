I went to a flea market on South Water Street in Providence this past weekend and purchased a bar of Lavender goats milk soap from Legend's Creek Farm. As soon as I picked it up I could tell it was going to make your skin feel so smooth! I could not wait to use it- It is absolutely amazing. Your skin feels smooth for a while and it makes you smell great! I also loved how it had bits and pieces in it that's good for exfoliating! One more thing- I didn't realize the farm was located in Foster, I live in Glocester and finding local products is the best feeling in the world. I highly recommend these products.
