It's hard for me to believe this is Melinda R. Morgan's first book. The mixture of music, spirituality, romance, science, and the unknown are neatly connected for our reading pleasure. The pacing is nice. No action just for action's sake. The events unfold smoothly. It was satisfying in its own right, but left me wanting more.
