There is nothing like a good &#34;who done it&#34; to while away a lazy afternoon. Of course there can be no comparison to one written by the estimable Agatha Christie and acted by the sublime David Suchet. Watching these mysteries in Blu-ray is icing for the little grey cells Mon Amie. Top that off with the beautiful art deco sets and period costumes, and all you want to do is kick back with a soothing cup of teasan and watch episode after episode. Highly recommended....enjoy !
