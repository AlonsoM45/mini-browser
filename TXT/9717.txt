I guess you get what you pay for. This wasn't like a study guide at all. It was just some practice questions like 20 for each part of the test. And you they gave you a,b,c,d answers but you couldn't even try and see if you knew the question because the answer was in a different color so you didn't know if that was what you were going to pick because you already saw the answer.
