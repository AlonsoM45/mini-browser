This was such a cute outfit the jacket was adorable but the flower I was expecting to be on it was not there when it arrived. But I still love it. The shirt is cute. But the pants are not what they seem to be in the picture. I ordered for a 12 month old and the pants look like they should be for an 18 month almost 2 yr old. Other then the flower not being there and the jeans it's aborable
