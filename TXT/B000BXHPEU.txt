We purchased a similar folding potty seat before this one (with cushion), but it was so unstable and made my daughter scared of sitting on adult toilet.This one is so perfect!It has non slip rubber on the base so it doesn't move and she has handle to hold on to so that she won't touch the dirty public toilet.I always bring a disinfectant wipe so i can wipe the seat after she's done.When folded, they are both similar in size although maybe this one is a bit longer but its thinner because it has no cushion.I like this seat better than the cushioned-version one, hands down.
