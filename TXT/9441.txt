I bought these for the cabinets I was making expecting them to deliver the same soft close as in the Blum drawer slide, which is very good. Problem is that the installation guide does not properly explain where to drill the holes. It says that the distance is 32mm plus the height of the mounting plate, but in their adjustable hinges if they are moved slightly inward it has the same effect as a raised plate. Secondly, even when that is taken into account, unless the door is very wide, it gets stuck on the piston and doesn't close unless it is pushed, which defeats the purpose. To properly install, I placed them 65mm away from the side of the cabinet and now thy work ok,just they are a bit quicker than the drawer slides and the doors with built in blumotion (which can be a good thing). Also, it is worthwhile to get a drilling assembly to accurately drilll the holes at 90 degrees; it can be messy if you don't.
