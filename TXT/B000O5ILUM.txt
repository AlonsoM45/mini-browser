There were a couple other reviews under the Glock front sight removal tool that suggested this one instead.  For the price, in comparison to the Glock tool... this thing is exactly what I needed at less than a quarter of the price.  I couldn&#699;t justify getting the Glock tool...especially when I&#699;m only going to use it maybe once or twice in the next 5+ years!!!Buy it...you won&#699;t regret it.  It fits, it works, and it&#699;s worth it.
