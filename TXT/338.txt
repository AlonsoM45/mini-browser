So theres already 12,009 reviews here! Everything i could say has been said - the books awsome! All these one star reviews - WHAT? I loved it, the whole series, beginning to end! It wasnt mind numbing to read, theres plenty to keep you entertained cover to cover. I couldnt put it down. The hunger games trilogy opened up a can of worms for me in this particular genre, lots of delightful worms!
