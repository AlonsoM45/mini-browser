Tinker and Linda Pearce have created a new approach to the history of Dwarves, Humans and Goblins. This epic tale is told from the point of view of Engvyr Gunnarson, the Dwarven Rifleman of the the title.Yes, there's conflict between nations and peoples. Yes, there's a war. Yes, there's grief and loss to deal with. Yes, there's a love story. But the bottom line here is that it's a timeless story of family and what lengths a person will go to in order to keep family and community safe.These are personalities that will get into your head, and you'll notice you're starting to look at things differently in your world as the story sweeps you along in theirs.Enthusiastically recommended!
