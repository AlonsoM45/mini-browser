I'm was initially hesitant to make this purchase but after reading some of the reviews, I went ahead and made the purchase.  I'm really glad I did.  This ring is solid and is surprisingly heavy for it's size.  To me that speaks of quality material and so far it's been exactly that.  It's beautiful and has a smooth shiny finish that seems to hold up well to everyday wear and doesn't seem to scratch easy.  The ring is true to size and fits me perfectly as a size 7 should.  I don't know why you would pay $100+ for a nice simple ring like this when you can have this for a fraction of that.  This is well worth the money, don't hesitate and buy it now.
