I have a one year old son and we gave him this toy for Christmas. he absolutely loves it. he likes the music mode best, he LOVES music. he understands that if he pushes one of the shapes down they sing and light up with the music which gets him dancing of course. he thinks it's a fun toy an  consumes his interest.
