I loved this one. I have both Inferno and just finished Rapture. A beautiful love story. Rapture was defintely better than Inferno, however, you have to read Inferno first to get the love story. I love how Gabriel is so in love with his beloved Julia. They are beautiful characters. I would love to see this in a trilogy to see how things go from here and follow the truest love story. And I would also like to see how the other characters in the book work out also. Racheal, Scott, Tom and his new romance, Paul (if the true friendship can last), but more than anything I'd love to see a reaction from Christa to know that she could not keep these lovers apart.
