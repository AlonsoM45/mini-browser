Well, it's original.  It's different.  It's terrifying.  It's daring.  It's animated.  It's sheer joy.  This game pretty much pushes the power of the PS2 to the limit.  I received it in the original case of course, and it wasn't too expensive to buy honestly.  If you're a PS2 collector, adventurer and like fantasy, you got to have this game.
