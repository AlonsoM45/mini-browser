I bought these for my Dad who leaves in North Carolina and quite often is outside but refuses to purchase anything like these himself. With the weather there this last week the new overalls have gotten a ton of use, my dad actually called to say how comfortable they were, how warm they kept him and how easy it is to move around in them, he wishes he had bought them a long time ago. Thanks for the perfect gift and a great product.
