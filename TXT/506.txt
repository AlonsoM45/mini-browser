I have charged it several times, and then attempted to charge my iPhone with it. I can't tell when it's working, and so far it has done nothing even though it was fully charged. It did not arrive with adequate instructions, and I would welcome any suggestions on how to use it correctly.  I gave it two stars rather than one because I figured there must be an error on my part and not totally on the part of the device itself.AMENDMENT TO MY REVIEW:  When I pushed down the small button for a quick 1/2 second, it finally registered with my phone and is charging it now. The error was on my part, albeit there are no decent instructions that come with it.  I am hoping for a quick charge.
