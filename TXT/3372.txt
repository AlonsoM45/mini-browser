To be honest, I picked up the novel only after hearing about the upcoming movie. So I didn't really have high expectations. But boy was I wrong. The story and the whole idea was great all in itself; but the story-telling, character development and attention to detail were on a refreshingly high level. Give it a try! Watching the movie will never give you the same level of satisfaction as reading the novel. And that's presuming the movie turns out to be decent.
