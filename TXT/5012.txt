I wrote a wonderful review when I received these shoes yesterday, they are really comfortable and cute, but today is day 2 of wearing them (for a total of about 5 hours) and the fabric that meets the heel on both shoes has started to tear and wear away due to friction on the pavement. The sole of the shoe ends about a quarter of an inch too soon, which forces the fabric right above the heel of the shoe to meet the floor when your heel touches the ground. Its too bad there is no option here to include a photo. These are not going to last very long. Buyer beware.
