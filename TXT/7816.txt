A good read. Alt of characters kept the plot interesting and so south Florida. Amazingly enough there is truth behind these types of folly. Being a true Floridian, I can say this. I would have liked more closure to the end, that's the negative. The pluses are is a light read, great Serge energy, and great facts. It's always a treat to read Dorsey with his use of real Florida landmarks.. thank you for that.
