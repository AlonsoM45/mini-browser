The book holder was great. It would be perfect and do the job if it was wide enough at the top to fit my treadmill. I wanted something to set my kindle fire on when I was on the treadmill and ordered this holder but it is not wide enough at the top to fit over the lip of my treadmill. Nice holder though!
