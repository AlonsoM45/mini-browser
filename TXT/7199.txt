The product arrived quickly and the packaging was nice. I have only been using this for a couple of weeks but I have noticed improvement in the way my skin looks and feels. My skin looks brighter and fine lines have shown some improvement. I have a couple of dark spots I hope will fade as I continue to use it. I had been using a different Vitamin C serum I purchased a couple of months before I found this one. It was priced the same but the results were not even close.  I have to say OUI is far superior and their customer service is excellent. I will be buying this product from them again.
