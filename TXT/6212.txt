These sandals are cute and comfortable.  I like the fact that they are affordable and made in Italy.  At first I was going to return them for a larger size ( i ordered the 7.5) but after trying them on a 2nd time, the leather stretched a little bit, so I am keeping them.  The studs are cute and give them spice.  the toe straps are comfortable and not rigid.  I highly recommend them.
