Still trying to figure this product out. The product is ok when I really need it to work it won't we charge it every night and it will work for 1 or 2 uses, but then it fizzles out.we have a German shepherd /Rottweiler mixed so she's a pretty big dog. I couldn't wait for this item to come in and I was thrilled that it work so well at first, but like I said after the second use it didn't faze her the power was weak. We keep trying because she hates to hear the warning beep she will back off which is good I hate to do any thing to her but if she needs it I want it to work, but I can't rely on it.
