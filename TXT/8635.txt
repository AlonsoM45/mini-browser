The previous reviewer didn't understand how this device is used. Though, I can't fault him too bad since it doesn't come with instructions. You are supposed to completely unscrew the top-cap bolt, and underneath is a larger bolt that expands the inner plug. Once you have the inner plug pressing against the inside diameter of the steerer tube, you can screw the top-cap in to actually preload the headset tension.On a metal steerer tube, you can then remove the whole thing if you wish, to save weight. On a carbon steerer, it is recommended to leave it in, so that you have something to counter the crushing force of the stem.Anyway, $8 shipped for a reusable plug that can set any material stem is definitely worth 5 stars.
