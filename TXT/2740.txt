This book is adorable. I love the story and the artwork is so awesome. I have bought 6 books to give to my grandchildren and my nieces and nephews children and I am buying more to give to their grandchildren. This book is a perfect story for all ages including grandparents. You'll love this book and so will your children and grandchildren.
