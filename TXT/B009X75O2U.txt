I saw these and decided to try them out. I love them! These wheels make it so much easier to practice a design that I want to try. I can test colors together and practice techniques so when I do my manicure, it turns out perfect! True, it's difficult to water marble these one at a time, or to use a sponge to add a gradient to one, but overall I love these practice wheels.
