Three knives at this price, nobody is expecting a high-end performance.  For the price they look nice and fun for throwing at soft targets.  Probably smart to throw over carpet v a hard tile or concrete surface.  Don't plan on using these for a street fight, they're only slightly better than screaming for help.
