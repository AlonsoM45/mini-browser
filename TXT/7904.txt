I received this product complimentary in my #vowvoxbox from influenster for testing purposes.  I thought this product had a great scent; the consistency was not too thick, which I find to be very helpful, especially during the 90+ degree days of the summer.  I found that once applied, the moisturizer absorbed quickly into my skin, without leaving behind an oily residue.  I used it once in the a.m., after cleansing my face and before bed, using the same routine (cleanse, moisturize).  Also, a little bit goes a long way with this product, which I am pleased with because that means one jar will last at least half a month.
