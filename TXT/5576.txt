This is one of the best cookbooks around. I am an avid cook and this book is one of those rare books where you want to cook EVERY recipe! They are easy, yummy, and have ingredients any cook can find in their local super market. Thanks Cook's Country for sharing your hours of prep work, ideas, and product reviews with us lay people.
