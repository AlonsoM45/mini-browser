I am very particuliar about the wallets I purchase.  It must have several card slots and at least 2 zipper compartments.  This wallet has that and more! It is so soft and the zipper work great.  the front compartment is perfect for change. I got the Espresso color and I love it.  It holds my checkbook and I still have room for extra things if needed.  I would usually never pay this much for a wallet, but I got tired of the cheapies breaking on me.  This is very well made and I should have this for years to come.  I would highly recommend this to everyone :)
