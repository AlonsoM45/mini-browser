A friend of mine urged me to download this book onto my Kindle/tablet, going on and on about how the Elizabeth series is so good. I read it just to get her off my back when I spoke with her next. Reluctantly, I sat down on my lunch hour and read it cover to cover, loosing track of all space and time. I was completely and utterly converted to this author and this series. Vivid imagery and a plotline which draws the reader in from the first paragraph through to the very last word--a quick and satisfying read. I could not wait to get the box set with the whole series so that I can find out what happens next. I am hooked! A fun and exciting breathe of fresh air!
