I ordered this for Christmas for my wife because she's wanted a shoe rack for quite a while now. When she opened it, she found that there were multiple large pressure fractures in the frame which would eventually lead to a very broken shoe rack. I arranged for Amazon to replace the item, which they did promptly. However, when the replacement arrived, I was quite upset to find that the same pressure fractures were present (and were actually worse than the first time).I do not recommend this as a purchase for someone that intends to give it away as a gift or for someone that has an immediate need. So far I've sent one back and am waiting for Amazon to pick up the second and replace it again. I'm sure I'll receive one that's worth keeping eventually, but so much for a Christmas gift for the wife...If I receive a third version that is cracked, damaged, or unusable, I will simply request a refund. I'm not going to continue wasting my time if there is no quality standard on this item.Stay away from this one.
