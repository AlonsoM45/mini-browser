I got these for my 5 year old girls. I decided to get a size 10 for my girl that usually wears a size 7 to 8 in pants and is 56 pounds. She was wearing a size 8 brief in fruit of the loom and they were too big on her, but due to the other reviews of them being on the small size I decided to get the size 10. They fit great! They looked a little big at first, but after washing them they fit perfect.I got a size 8 for my other girl. She was wearing a size 6 in fruit of the loom briefs and size 6X to 7 in pants..she weighs about 50 pounds. They also fit her perfectly. Definitely be aware of the sizing, as they are running smaller than others. The material is a little thin, but my girls say they are very comfortable.
