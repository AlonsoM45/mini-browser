I had a flatware set that I picked up from Big Lots.  They started rusting after 6 months.  After a month of research, I bought this set.  They have a good weight to them and the style feels good when in use.  I especially like the beveled tip on the handle.  I fits in such a way in your hand as to make it feel secure.  The knifes cut great!! My only complaint is I wish there were more spoons in this set.
