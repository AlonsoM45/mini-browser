Higman aims to provide a succinct and abridged history of the Caribbean to a general audience, from pre-Columbian times to the present. Acknowledging first the problems that confront any attempt at coherently defining &#8220;the Caribbean,&#8221; he limits his survey to the island societies of Spanish, Dutch, French, and English heritage, omitting such territories as Florida or the Guyanas.Higman organizes the matter chronologically, starting with a synopsis of the region&#8217;s formative and ongoing geological activity and a brief biogeography. Maps and graphics of prehistoric Ta&iacute;no artifacts are used to help illustrate this &#8220;ancient archipelago.&#8221; Columbus&#8217;s four journeys to the Caribbean introduce consequences of culture-contact and prepare for environmental, economic, and social transformations that become more apparent at the end of the &#8220;second sixteenth century&#8221; (1530-1630). Slavery and its ends on plantations, backed with some demographic considerations, ground Higman&#8217;s brief primer on the two prevailing models of framing the Caribbean &#8211; plural or creole societies. Higman also traces developments from abolition to the present, using the events from the English Caribbean as a guidepost, but notes important departures in the stories of Cuba and Haiti, respectively.This nooks-and-crannies book is a fine reference textbook, and appears to streamline current opinion on the state of research on the region well &#8211; it is a friendly and intelligent digest. Its deliberate omission of in-text documentation, however, is frustrating. Finally, the absence of both the Cayman Islands and Bermuda is puzzling, considering the former&#8217;s proximity to Jamaica and the latter&#8217;s resemblance in form and function to the ABC islands of the Dutch.
