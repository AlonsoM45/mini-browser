After more than a month of use, the Infrared units are holding up great. The Beam is very powerful and can be reflected off things across the room and then come back and hit the eye. The wire supplied wasnt bad either, but the splicing connectors, even though they are of genius design, end up cutting the wire too much and losing connection. I ended up replacing all the existing wire and splicing the new units in the old fashioned way with just a twist and some electrical tape. Other than that, works fine.
