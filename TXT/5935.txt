My daughter loves this learning tool and fits nicely with the ABA Therapy we are also doing. Both family and therapists find the Cash Register easy to use and very life-like.We especially like the credit card processing facility on the register.Only one thing I would suggest is to please add the ability to change the Currency type to the Australian Dollar for example.  That would make it perfect.
