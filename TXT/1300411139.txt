When you read a thriller, you root for the good guy and hang onto their coat tails wherever the wild ride takes you.  With Liz Raci's book, you hang on for dear Life, and this time the bad guys are those nameless hateful people at B of A.  I laughed so much when I was reading it, It almost helped me to not hate the all powerful B Of A.  Almost, but not quite.  Who wouldn't crack up reading what is unarguably the most unromantic proposal in History.  I quote, "We had been living together for a few years when I finally said, "Are you gonna marry me or what?"  His respnse was, "If I have to..." Freakin funny! How our heroine gets out of this process with her positive attitide still intact is downright inspiring.  My own home was in foreclosure several times before we were finally successful, and each one of us could write our own story, but it wouldn't be as funny, encouraging and enlightening as this one.  In my heart of hearts, I hope Banks like B of A suffer for their greed, But after reading this book, I think I'll leave that up to God.
