Well, i bought this headset thinking turtle beaches, they gotta be pretty good. Not the case at all. The right side stopped working entirely the second week mabey and i am very careful with them. Also they come with an echo reduction cord that you have to have in your controller all the time and is super annoying. Last thing is that the cords are a mile long and always in the way. Do yourself a favor pay more to get a better wireless set.
