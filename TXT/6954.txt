I am a Leatherman fan. I hate the old, original tools, but find that their new designs more than meet my needs in a multi tool. When my wife saw what I'd gotten her for Christmas(2012), she all but squealed! Made me happy that she was happy!I strongly suggest researching each tool before buying one. Chances are super high that they have one for your lifestyle, but don't buy one based on price or &#34;cool&#34;factor.
