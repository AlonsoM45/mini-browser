This book had me on my toes the entire time.. I couldn't stop reading it! River was just a dream, his songs, his everything is just wow... He was so sweet and understanding with Dahlia. This book is a MUST READ. I cried, I laughed, I smiled.. That cliff hanger left me wanting more so I went and got Torn right away. Thank You Kim!!
