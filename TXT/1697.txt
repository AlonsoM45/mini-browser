Amazing story! I would recommend this book to everyone.  I couldn't put it down.  I am impatient for book 2!  The characters are given with enough detail to draw you into their lives and have you rooting for them, or hating them. Gave 4stars because of all the errors, when you have to try to decipher what is being said it slows the pace and flow of the story.
