I put off buying this for years.  I broke down and I have not regretted the decision. Installation was a little tricky with my full faced helmet due to a sun visor operator on the left side of my helmet.  I put this on the right which works out fine because I can do everything via voice commands.  They say there is a way to bang the units together to get them to connect to each other.  I have only gotten this to work once.  The web site stuff is pretty useless except for programming the headset.  This allows you to assign names (which it announces) and groups.  I do not think I will ever be able to ride without this again.  I absolutely love it and would buy it again.
