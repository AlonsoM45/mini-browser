I should have trusted my instinct and bought a size B but I went with the C looking at the size chart spanx had online. Unfortunately they don't feel tight enough. Typically the higher power is firm and the material is durable but this one feels like I could rip them easily. I'm 5' 6&#34; (36-29-39) and I weigh about 140. Shipping was fast and amazon was great I just should have bought a smaller size. The best part of the spanx design is the open gusset although I never use it for what its intended for...it's a good feature though.
