It was not as depicted in picture. Picture showed an aluminum or similar type finish.  Came in 100t% plastic. My husband put it on anyway and it looks fine. Time will Tell. I would not have purchased if I had known it was plastic. I guess that's what marketing does, show you a superior product and sell you an inferior product in the hopes you wont send it back?
