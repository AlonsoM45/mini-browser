This was a costume for a school project. We actually used it for Amerigo Vespucci. It's small on the sizing though. Stitching on the back of the top came undone straight away and I don't think my repair will hold for many more wears as the fabric is very flimsy. But not hugely expensive and if you're not creative and need a quick and easy costume, then it's ideal!
