I bought this product a year ago for 2 stray,somewhat feral cats who now basically live on my balcony. Though not a perfect product, it is really a good one. The cats do stay pretty warm n dry. The winters are pretty cold in the Northeast and they sleep in it every nite. I think that it's pretty waterproof. Snow has gotten on the roof and it stayed dry inside.My only gripe is that it's  really not big enough, so  I just purchased the larger size.
