It's ok i guess, when spraying out it sometimes never comes out of can evenly. Also it is kinda strong smell at first, so might want to check your allergy to it first in a small test area. It does mask odors or etc for animals or just heavy traffic areas and will die down on odor strength after a few hours or a day. After  three days though its not even noticable but no odor.
