My girlfriend and I recently started our N-Force collection, and we already have a considerable selection to choose from when we battle.  These are great fun and her little boy loves them so much too!Nerf always make great products and this is no exception.Arrived well in time for Christmas, my only gripe was that the surprise was ruined with an error in the gift wrapping that I had paid just under $6 but Amazon's customer service were GREAT, responding and refunding the gift wrap price almost immediately after I took it up with them.I've done almost all of my Christmas shopping through Amazon and have no regrets (a fair few nerf products and all the others were gift wrapped fine, so I guess this was just an anomaly)Thank you to the seller and to Amazon for great customer service.
