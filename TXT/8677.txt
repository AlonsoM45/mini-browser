Very happy with my new little Bissell Little Green cleaner.  I had so much upholstery to clean, that I have used it over and over.  It works great, does a great job, is lightweight enough, and easy to figure out and use.  Only suggestion is that the accordian tubing to the appliances could be a little longer.
