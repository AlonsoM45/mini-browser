I could not stop reading. It's a page turner. I like that Michael Jr. didn't turn out to be just like his dad. I don't like that fact his father keeps getting away. He's just too evil. I think he's really the DEVIL. Can't wait to start book three. I recommend this book to anyone to read. I take that back, not no Christian. Lol.
