I paid for the Action Replay DS, and I got it. But the problem is, it's one of the early versions of it and it was shipped to me with no AR CD/cord to quickly add games and cheat codes to my Action Replay DS; which means I have to insert everything manually with my DS touch screen's crappy keyboard.It can perform all the cheats Codejunkies has to offer, but if it's not pre-set, be prepared to spend a hell of a long time typing in each code.
