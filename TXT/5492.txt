WOW. I am so happy with this purchase. I bought them as a cool keepsake, memory holder. My mom went to see the Eiffel Tower many years ago, and i bought for her stocking, and my sons, and one for myself. Wonderful. Better than i expected. What an HONEST, Trustworthy seller. HIGHLY Recommend seller. A true asset to Amazon. Nice pencil, makeup brush case. I myself will use for my next cruise for small items to be kept in one spot.
