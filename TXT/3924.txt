I bought this for my son for Christmas and I'm glad I ordered it with enough time to return it and purchase a different one. I opened it and pulled it by the handles to get it out of the box and immediately noticed that under the handles the plastic is sharp. The squares that you would hold with your hands is very uncomfortable just being squared in shape but it's even worse when the plastic at the underside of it isn't finished and has rough edges. This is not well thought out. I returned it and purchased the blue whale that has yellow plastic round finished handles to spare my kids' fingers and hands!
