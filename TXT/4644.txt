This is the second time buying off of Amazon.  Not the greatest so far.  I ordered these protector covers for my galaxy S2 per the picture, description, and customer comments and reviews of this seller.  I got these in an envelope not in any kind of packaging.  Immediately I saw they were not the right ones.  They are not what the picture looks like.  The pic has 2 cutouts at the top for the camera and the sound and this has one long cutout for both.  Plus these are way too small.  They don't cover the whole screen at all.  I have set up a return hoping they will send me the right ones.  I really don't care about the refund I just want the right covers.  I will mail back tomorrow and follow up with a post of what happened.  Had to pay my own postage for return also.  Pretty cheap for their error.
