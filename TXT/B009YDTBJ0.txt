Got the shawl to use with a sleeveless evening gown for a wedding.  This will do nicely.  The chiffon material is nice, has a little weight to it...that's a good thing.  The hems are finished nicely; no lose threads.  Just needs a little steam to take the packaging crease out and I'll be ready to go.
