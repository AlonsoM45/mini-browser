I loved the book, and while it was a tad bit short (2 sittings...) I find that I got attached to the characters rather fast, and wanted to know more about them. I didn't like the ending however, seeing as it was kind of sudden. I could see it coming, but I went to the kindle store to get the second book in the series, but either they don't have it, or it isn't out yet. Either way, I can't wait for it! It's pretty cheap, but for being so short I would expect that. 2.99 is a good price though. Just hope the next book won't be any more than that. (Unless it's a couple-hundred pages longer :P)
