I'm not sure what more I could add that other reviewers haven't mentioned. I purchased this book mainly because I wanted a reference book filled with tons of beautiful photos of Native American blankets. Sure enough, the book delivered! It is my understanding that, unlike the first Chasing Rainbows, this book's photos have all been taken with a fancy digital camera which makes all of the images really pop with vibrant colors. Beyond the photos, Friedman provides a brief guide to understanding the history of the companies that were behind the blankets, thus providing context for the wonderful photos. In the end, however, it is the marvelous photos that show off the exquisite blankets that will keep me coming back again and again to flip through the pages of this fantastic book.
