Within 2 months(on Feb 9th), it's broken now. An after service center in Seoul(ROK) said. I need to bring it to the country(The US) where I bought it. Isn't this product a laptop which is easy to move around the world? I bought this product not only because it's cheap but also it's a product of HP which has a wide area of service chain world-wide. So, I don't understand why I have to bring the product myself to get service for a SSD malfunction?I don't recommend this product now.I bought it since it has SSD inside which is more vibration resistant and fast in multi processing stage.As a matter of fact, I was at a loss when it did not boot at first.However, I found out that I need to separate the battery and put it back again to make this laptop boot for the first time.Now it is working as normal. I'm writing this message using the laptop and over all judgement on this machine is that it is working as I expected. However, I don't know why it is this heavy. In fact, it is as heavy as the one with HDD on it or heavier than that.Still it boots fast cause it has SSD in it. Beside the speed, consider the price $400 something is super cheap at its performance isn't it?
