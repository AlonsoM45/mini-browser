The quality isn't great, but that is to be expected for the price.I like it mainly for the case and all the smaller brushes it comes with for eyeshadows and lips, etc.The face brushes are not soft.I'm not a huge makeup fanatic but I could tell the quality wasn't great.Fast shipping though and as not bad considering the price!
