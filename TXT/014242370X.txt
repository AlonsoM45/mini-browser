Thethird book is action-packed. If you like action, you will be served in this one! There is almost no break, we go from one place to an other. There is no time to waste before the final battle happens. Between the planning and the hunt for the pieces of the cross, of course there was also a time for romance.Calla is still torn between Shay and Ren. When she's with one, she can't stop thinking about the other. I was a little disappointed with what she did with both men. She acted selfish and it was like she didn't think about their feelings. I think she should have done things differently.The end ruined it for me. I enjoyed the book so much, but I still can't believe what happened. I was really really really disappointed to read how the love triangle ended because it was one of the easiest possible way to do it. That's the worst ending someone could ever imagine. I don't understand why, I just don't.But a good read anyway. I think even with all the disappointed fans, you need to read it to see for yourself. One scene doesn't make the book. I was also pleased to see that Andrea Cremer decided to write a fourth book in the trilogy: Snakeroot and I will definitely read it! I'm intrigued about what it will be about.
