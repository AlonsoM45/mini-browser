I have a Nexus 5. I can lay it on here at almost any angle and it starts to charge.  The only thing I do not like is the blue LED that blinks to tell you it is charging is bright and very easy to see.  Kind of gets annoying at night, on the dresser, next to the bed, when you are trying to sleep.  A piece of black tape with a pin whole fixed it.
