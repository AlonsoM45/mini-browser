I received mines this morning. I placed it on my phone and it came off. The adhesive on the glass didn't even stick to my phone at all. It was a waste of my money. If I could get a replacement I would be more than happy. Other than that It was a big disappointment. I was really looking forward to having this on my phone because I heard it is the best protector there is. Also the glass came with scratches.
