I bought these to wear at my wedding. I love the blue birds. The boots are pointy but I don't think it is too much like some other people have said. I did order them a half size smaller like other people have posted. I have large calf muscles so it can be hard for me to wear certain shoes that are taller. These fit me without a problem and I was actually surprised! The boot is also comfortable compared to some of my other cowboy boots.
