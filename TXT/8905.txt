I bought this for my home, liked it so much I purchased another for the office I run as well for staff.My husband and I are new to juicing, this is cheap enough for us since we were skeptical and easy enough to clean and maintain. I followed the food instructions on what to cut up verses putting in whole as well as the cleaning instructions. Very simple, we use it twice per day as meal replacements - have already lost weight and overall feel better.The same juicer I got for the office is used at least five times per day, same thing everyone follows the food and cleaning instructions exactly, a month later with heavy use it is still like new. I highly recommend this item, great experience so far.
