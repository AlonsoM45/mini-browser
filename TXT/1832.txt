I am the HCG Queen, so anything even remotely related to it, I am going to check it out. This was the worst dressing I have ever tasted in my life. It is pure water with ZERO taste. For almost $16 a bottle, this is A JOKE! I also ordered the other flavor; same thing. I am extremely disappointed, and prefer my OACV and Lemon Juice dressing I make myself, for a fraction of the price. I cannot believe people are saying this is good!
