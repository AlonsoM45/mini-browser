I have never been a cookbook reader, but surprisingly I loved this one. Not only does it teach you to cook it teaches you how to transform your life into a healthier one. It taught me about the Standard American Diet and how it causes many diseases that people suffer from today. I loved that it taught me not only how to cook delicious meals but also how to be healthier. I was looking for a way to better myself and the foods I ate, and I can say that this book defiantly did this for me. It&#8217;s perfect for beginners, easy to read and very easy to follow the directions it provides. Best cookbook I have read in a very long time
