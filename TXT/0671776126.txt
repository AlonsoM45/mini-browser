Time flew by when I was reading this book due to the depth and comfort felt with each and every character. A book that has you empathising with people who are in situations that are, hopefully, totally alien to you.This book has you thinking of life styles and life choices from angles you never knew existed.I envisage Ellie and Coop having a wonderfully happy, contented life together and Katie eventually carving a satisfying life for  herself. But I am unsure if she would end up sharing it with Samuel or just devoting herself to being the best person she can be.
