whenever I paint my nails I put this on as a top coat, and in about 10 minutes my nails are perfectly dry. I love that they become really solid, because I hate walking around trying not to touch anything in fear of messing my nails up. the one thing I will say is it does make my nail polish peel, it wont chip, but if you get nervous and play with your nails, I wouldn't recommend this for you.
