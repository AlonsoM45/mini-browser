A very complicated book,  that I don't really feel was intended just for the average reader,  although,  I can't allow my own lack of knowledge over the subject affect my review. This book I about exactly what it states,  a voyage in a balloon,  I came into it believing it was chronicling the voyage of the men who landed on the island in the book &#34;The Mysterious Island&#34;... It doesn't,  not even close,  still,  it was an interesting read,  and worth the time spent on it.
