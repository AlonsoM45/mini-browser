I was first introduced to ClariS via the television anime Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai. (My little sister can't be this cute) Oreimo  for short. Irony is the opening theme song and has a great beat and amazing lyrics. Claire and Alices' voices are like nothing you've heard before. Check it out and check out Oreimo, its a wonderful show.
