I'm a fan of spigen, I dropped a $100 on one of their Ipad cases before and I still use it till now. So I didn't hesitate to purchase a case from them for my GS4 and the case looked beautiful; people didn't even recognize the phone when it was on. but forward 3 weeks later and the rubber back started deforming due to the phone's heat. My headphones jack fit into the cut out so it only affected me when I'm at a friend's and using their speakers, so due to the plastic part being as fragile as most reviews say it eventually broke and now I have a phone without a case, thank you Spigen.
