I have always had problems with my weight and eating healthy. Lately I have been looking for a more efficient way to get the vitamins I need without all the hassle. That when I came across juicing. I had wanted to do this for a while but I never really knew how. That&#8217;s why I love this book. I taught me everything I needed to know about juicing. It makes it so much easier than it would have been. This book not only teaches you how to juice, it also teaches you what to juice. I taught me what ingredients to use to get the most nutritional value. Because of this book I&#8217;m now a juicer and I&#8217;ll never go back.
