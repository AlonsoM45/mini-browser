This works well if you cut the onion in half or quarters but will not work well with a whole veggie etc. It's plastic so i see this in the future breaking at some point when pushing down with force, but for now it works as advertised. Has two removable sized grids which I used by itself once on a potato.  Dishwasher safe! and comes with cleaning tool for top underside.
