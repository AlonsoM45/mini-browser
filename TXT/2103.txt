For some reason the color on this is not true.  Mickey's face is pink as if he has a sunburn.  And it's not a computer monitor issue - the picture on the package looks like normal, but on the blanket itself, he's pink.  Have to return it, just glad I still have time before the birthday party!!The price was right, but the quality was wrong, so I would not recommend this to anyone.
