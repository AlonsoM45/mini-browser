The shoes arrived with the toe smudged a little missing the color, but I was happy to find some cute boots in a wide width in my size. Although they are supposed to be wide with shoes, they're cut the same as a regular shoe. The reason wny the shoes were narrow is because I was shipped a 12B US when I ordered a 12W. I normally go up a size in boots, so that was fine for me. I only wish they had more cushion in the shoe. I would have actually liked to have gotten what I ordered, but I still like the shoes. They have poor shock absorption, and would be better if they came as a platform. So the shoe is comfortable after wearing them all day, but your feet hurt because it's like you walking around all day on concrete even if the office has carpeting and you're wearing thick socks.
