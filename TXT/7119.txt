This is a gorgeous book for anyone.  Whether your a child or a child at heart you will enjoy this beautifully illustrated, well written book.  It is the story about a little girl, Princess Jasmine. and her older sister, a dog named Moo.  They get to travel all around the world to meet Moos fur-riends and on the way learn valuable life lessons that every child should learn.  I loved the book just from the illustrations, love it more when I read it.  I feel this is one book that you will love also.  I just hope Dr Debbie Mamone continues the series and graces us with another excellent book of her "Once Upon a Rose Princess"
