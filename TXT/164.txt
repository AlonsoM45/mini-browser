I purchased the Bushnell GPS so we could find our way back to our starting point when we were walking while on vacation. It worked when I tested it in our home town, but was not able to find the satellite when I really needed it when we were vacationing in Aruba and later in St Petersburg Fl.Since it won't work in the situations where I need it the most, it is totally worthless to me. I am extremely disappointed and would strongly recommend against buying this product.Clifford JoensTryon, NC
