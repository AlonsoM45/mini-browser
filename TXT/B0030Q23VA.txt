Very good tire and rim cleaner. It cleans tires and rims with hardly any scrubbing, none if reasonably light dust. For years i used a dollar store cleaner made by quick stuff inc but that was discontinued as company went OOB. This is good if you can get Eagle One AtoZ at a good price, this is the only cleaner by eagle one I like or would use. Have used it on chrome and aluminum rims with no issues of acidity or tire markings.
