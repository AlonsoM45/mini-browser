I am very happy with my purchase , delivered on time , despite of other reviewer I got the new one, not the used one, the mixie is definitely yes for the indian kitchen , I used many other blender, grinder which we get in USA but not useful for making chutni , batter etc, I will say dont waste money for other blender/magic bullet kindda stuff if u hold the indian kitchen , this is the best.
