Having bought this buggy as an entry level product with a view to getting back in to buggy racing then it was just what I was after. You can run it virtually stock in many clubs and this means it's down to your driving as to whether you win. It's great flying over jumps and better than the slash in this respect. However, you are well advised to buy the wheelie bar as under full throttle it wheelies virtually every time, which you may think is fun, and it is to start with but when you fire the power down hard coming out of a tight turn then it's just what you don't want. They are around $11-12 on amazon and are what I would class as an essential purchase. Buying a set of bearings will help increase the speed and more importantly the run time, and I'd recommend fitting a set as your second upgrade. Both of these are normally accepted mods but if you are planning on going racing check your clubs class rules.Battery life? 8-12 mins with the standard battery and then 8 hours for a recharge is not much fun, so budget for a larger capacity Nimh battery and a fast charger, the first will increase your run time, the second will charge it back up in around 45 mins, much more fun for you and /or your kids.You can even fit a Lipo 2S but will need a matching charger, combined this could cost you $150+. I would therefore suggest a 5000Mah Nimh on amazon at under $50 and a fast charger at $30-40 will be a much better bet for most people. You can purchase an 8 cell hump pack which will also increase the Rustlers top speed to over 40mph with the extra gear fitted. Note though that to fit an 8 cell pack you will need to fit the 'Battery expander pack' - a bargain at under $6.I would therefore say the rustler gives great fun in the back yard or on the racetrack at a very low price, but budget for an extra battery, fast charger and wheelie bar as they are all essential. The bearings are a good 'nice to have' option.
