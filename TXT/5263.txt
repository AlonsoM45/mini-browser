my first heli a bit of a challenge in a small space or outdoors but that's what i was looking for as its pretty fast. responsive. cheap, durable and loads of fun a great starter as ive crashed it countless times brought it to a birthday party and my brother and nephew are now placing orders how cool will that be,, i also ordered the big bag of parts and 5 pack of 200 mha batterys at the same time and i get better performance and longer flight time other recomindations are to protect the wiring on the rear motor i used heat shirnk tubing around the whole motor.. manually adjust the rods that connect the rotor and fly bar to the swash plate if it don't hover close to in one place then fine tune with the trim buttons and remember you tube is your freind
