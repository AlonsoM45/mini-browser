I bought these for my Mom and the slippers were delivered way ahead of schedule. She was very happy with how they fit and the amount of cushion they had.  She has never owned a nice pair of house slippers before, usually cheap Walmart specials. She liked the thickness of the soles and how she can walk out to the mailbox and not feel every little pebble on the driveway. My Mom is always on her feet and she said she will never buy another cheap pair of slippers again after wearing these all day.
