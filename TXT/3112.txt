Can I start by saying I LOVE these extensions. They are really cute!! I loved them so much I bought more sets of these and I do them in peoples hair at boutiques and events!! I have not had one single complaint about them at all. They work for all hair types, hair colors, and hair lengths. plus they are cute for all ages, not just teens. I have put them in toddler girls hair for pictures, teens hair, babys for pictures, even moms that just want a edgy young vibrant look (im one of them). I love these extensions and will ways be purchasing from these guys.
