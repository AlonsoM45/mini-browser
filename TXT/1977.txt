I'm the kind of girl who doesn't wear skirts too often, so when I wanted to get one, I wasn't sure what to get.  I'm glad I picked this as one of my first skirts.  A lot of skirts that I've seen around stores are super thin and look like they can break easy.  This one was made of a thicker material.  I guess you can compare it to felt, but I'm 100% sure it's not felt.  It just had that texture to it, and is more stiff than felt actually is.  The skirt is at a fair length on me, a couple inches above the knee.  Maybe for someone of my stature it would be nice to have some shorts under, but otherwise, I thought it was really cute.  I bought the black one, and I wouldn't be surprised if I bought another!
