Wonderful. I have super dry skin with eczema and this has in the 3 days i have been using it helped lots. I rub into my elbows a few drops back of heels, and palms of hand and relax watch tv and after catching up on my latest tv show, it has soaked in. No bad smell or gross excess oil feeling for me. HIGHLY Recommend buying from this seller too. Packages arrive in a timely and well packaged manner. An Honest, Reliable seller for sure. Happy Holidays
