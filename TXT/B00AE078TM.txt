I started using this product about 8 months ago and have been very pleased. I am very sensitive to other shampoos including very high end products. After using CLEAR I shortly noticed a significant improvement in the health of my scalp and hair. My hair is naturally wavy and requires additional products to keep the frizz down. With CLEAR Frizz control I don't need to use additional products and it takes less time to get ready in the morning.I have referred this product to many people and now my sister and her family and brother and his family are using this. They are all very satisfied.Highly recommended. Your hair will look amazing in less than a week.
