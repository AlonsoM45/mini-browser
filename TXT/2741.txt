I love Ellen's Show and I think she's one of the funniest women around. So I was looking forward to read her book... and got very disappointed. This book was just another way for her to make more money. It's funny at the beginning but it's getting old after the first few pages. She just takes random subjects and writes 2 or 3 pages about it; the chapters have no connection at all. You can tell that she just tried to "fill" as many pages possible. For example her chapter about Meditation: 4 blank pages!!! I wouldn't mind that much if her book had been 4$ or less... but paying the prize for a "real" book (where every page is written on) is just too much! DISAPPOINTING
