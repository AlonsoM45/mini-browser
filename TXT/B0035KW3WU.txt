For the price, this is a great item.  I don&#699;t really use the magazine pouches, but I put my Glock magazines in them and they fit great. I ended up putting the pouches on my backpack for things like a flashlight and glowsticks.As for the belt itself.  It&#699;s made well. Buckle seems to be pretty decent.  It&#699;s not a cobra buckle, but for the price, I&#699;ll take it.  I use it as sort of a &#34;duty belt&#34; with kydex pistol and AR-15 magazine holsters on my left side, my little rolled dump pouch towards the back, a kydex Glock holster on my right, with my survival knife just behind the holster. I have enough room to even add a mini blow-out kit.Four stars for another good product from Condor.
