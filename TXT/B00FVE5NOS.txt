I probably didn't read as much as I should have. You know, the fine print. I checked the ratings to see if it was appropriate for my kids. To my surprise , all I got was a very slow going story, comic book style. Then an opportunity to buy the full version. Looks to have potential, however without trying it, didn't buy it.
