I have love hair and with the rollers it really helped the straightener to glide down and perfectly straighten my hair. I like it.  I even use it on my daughters long hair and she doesn't complain one bit. We both would say go ahead any get it ...oh yeah and itcworks better then my other 2 pricier straighteners.
