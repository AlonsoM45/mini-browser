Lampos deals with very difficult teaching situations in a very practical manner. Using true-life stories from her own experience, she weaves easily applicable educational principles throughout the book --- and she does it painlessly. "Teaching Diamonds in the Tough" is devotional in format, but don't let the casual structure fool you. This book has very powerful, sometimes heart-wrenching, stories of troubled children, their struggles and successes. And it presents some of the most workable ideas for teaching students like this that I have ever seen. Our culture is moving so fast in this direction that we are in danger of losing an entire generation if we don't learn how to teach, guide and mentor troubled students with love and acceptance. This book is a great tool for the job.David E. FessendenAuthor ofTeaching with All Your Heart: Bringing Curriculum & Class to Life
