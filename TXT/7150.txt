The Saferest California King mattress and box spring encasements appear to be durable and good quality. I cannot comment on how long they will last because I just bought them.  The micro zippers appear to be good quality and have velco covers at the end which appear to be effective.  They fit the mattress and box springs well, and the mattress encasement has a nice soft terrycloth top. I am completely satisfied with these encasements at this point.
