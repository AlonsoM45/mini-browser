Provides great protection, doesn't make the iPhone feel too bulky or big, lightweight rubber case.The only issue I found (and I mean the &#34;only&#34; part) was that at the bottom, where you plug in the charger, there is a line of rubber in between each of the speakers and the actual plug-in hole, making it very hard/uncomfortable to plug it in and practically impossible with some of the bigger cords (like the one I use in my car to charge it or connect it to the car's speakers). However, once I cut these off (any kind of small knife will do it, it doesn't need to be sharp at all) the case worked perfectly with any kind of charging/linking device and I am very satisfied with it.
