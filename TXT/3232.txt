Like most people as they age, I have marionette lines around the mouth and nose area.  I have chosen not to use fillers or to have surgery so am always looking for products that will enhance my almost 71 years old skin.  This product is excellent!  It has greatly diminished the lines around my mouth and actually lifted and minimized those around my nose area.  It is expensive but well worth the price.  I'm on my third bottle now and, on my skin, it is nothing short of miraculous.
