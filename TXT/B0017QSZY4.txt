The safty razor replaced the razor and strap.  It was an improvement over the razor.  Todays safty razors are an improvement over the original safty razor. I found I cut myself whenever I used it probably because I'm not use to useing it.  This butterfly razor is well made but the one side of the razor doesn't alow the blade to protrude (as needed) as much on one side as the other. I've gone back to using todays safty razor.
