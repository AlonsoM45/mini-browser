Morgan's Hunter is a great read! It has everything, love, suspense, heartbreak... It kept me wanting to read more.  I love the dynamic between Morgan and Hunter, the writer makes it so easy to connect with the both of them.  I felt like I was laughing, crying or on the edge of my seat throughout the whole book.  I'm excited to start book 2!!
