i just got this light today in the mail. its very bright which i thought it wasnt going to be so thats a plus. it seems heavy duty, i bought am extention cord ahead of time and im glad i did cause the cord it coiled very tight and probably wont reach very far. other than that only time will tell. ill give an update soon once i have been on a few jobs with it and once it rains heavy on it and everything. the only reason i put 4 stars is because when its plugged in and you turn your car on it automatically turns on to the first of 7 unique patterns so you have to push the button 7 times to turn it off. other than that its a great buy so far. i know it will light up the area at night because of how bright it is in the day time. bye for now.
