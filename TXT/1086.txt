This is probably the best deal on the Internet for my Samsung Galaxy S3. I paid under 3 dollars for the case. I was very reluctant at first because I was thinking no way this case is going to fit,, something has to be wrong.... Nope, it fit really snug and is very slim along with a belt clip holder.  I don't recommend it for a construction worker or some one who works out doors, but it does have a belt clip that faces the phone inward which protects it.Don't pass the deal up.
