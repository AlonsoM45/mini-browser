I just received the dictionary today after placing the order more than one month ago. I visited the post office to check the package by myself and I could finally got it. Around 100 pages were in shrink condition that I have to put them back into their right place. I wonder where those pages started to shrink; is it from the packaging point or at the checking or customs point?.While reading the words and their definitions I found that they are very clear and understandable. Everything almost as perfect as I've been expected to. However, there are things that caused me to conclude that it is only a four starred dictionary. The first is the paper which is too thin, which is easily torn apart. Secondly, there is no colorful picture to attract my eyes. Thirdly, I need more encyclopedic definitions about some worldly events like the 9/11 2001 in New York. In my opinion there should be a picture of the "late" twin towers along with the list of suspects, both individual and organization, and more detailed story about what exactly has happened in the 9/11 event. But most of all, it is a quite satisfying dictionary which must be collected by everyone who is serious in English.
