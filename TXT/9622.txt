this processor is just like the other amd fx chips, it does NOT have a throttling issue! you simply see it go to 1.4ghz if your system is not running any programs, but you can make it 4.0ghz all the time, just change power settings in the bios, ie, cool n quite and the c settings, also change power settings in windows and you should no longer see the "throttling"UPDATE. My hard drive is a slow one from 2008. it is bottle necking my system and causing my whole system to perform worse! also my video card is the GTS-250 1GB and may also be slowing things down, all else is up to date.... So when i get a faster harddrive and better video card i will update this to show just how much better this cpu is than the 1055T and fx 6100, as those were my previous AMD processors. but in my opinion if anyone has the 1055T it was what i wish I had and stuck with the whole time. but not getting the 8120 or 8150 was the smart choice i did make! the 1055T was a BEAST but the fx-6100 was the BEST overclocker, got it up to 4.7GHZ @ 6cores and 5GHZ @2 cores. the stock power of the 8350 will make you feel good if you do not have liquid cooling for overclocking. I have liquid cooling and with it you will be happy with any of these processors.stick with the 1055T if you already have itgo with the fx-6100 if you love overclocking and have liquid cooling (and you are a cheap) dont let the stock clock make you think this is better than the 1055T!!!go with the 8350 if you do not already have the 1055T BUT if you want the 8350 and have comfy money for it , get it, ifnact the best amd fx is the 8320 @150 dollars.... but this is a cost ratio, so get the best processor to suit your budget and tech wants.im not an intel guy or amd guy, i am a price guy, and the 8350 hit the spot for me and i have done research with the 3 different CPUs. compare to intel? heck no those cost too much and are not worth the quality increase that is if there is any for real world use anyway! i wish i had known all of what i do now, i would have stuck with the 1055T, and got the 8350 when the price hit around 150 dollars, other wise price per money, get the 8320. my research will save you from spending money on a cpu that does not fit your tech needs, face it, all these cpus do what you will need, but you want to be the next god among your friends with this new cpu purchase!ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW.........The only problem i had with this was it needed a fresh install of windows 7.... saw a huge increase in performance and i am working to make sure i see it the whole time i use this processor, one person somewhere said it was not any better than the 6100, fact is it sometimes performs about the same, but is capable of a lot better performance. Like i say, i just need time to figure what the settings should be. So far, the 6100 hundred cant even perform equal at a full overclock. the 8350 0n stock is a real treat in itself! and the odd thing is how you change no settings only a reboot and the performance drops to the 6100s level. I am seeing this as being the reason why intel fans hate this cpu line as it is not fluent in its highest performance.......... but in the future i am optimistic about .I dont go by benchmarks, i go by what i saw for the programs i was using and how consistent the programs ran each time i booted my computer for a use with unchanged settings.this processor is surely capable of more than what i have, as i have seen its promise even without the hotfix installed as of nowhowever if you are looking to build a cheap pc , go with the 6100, but if you want the best there will be, the 8350 is a great idea . for its cost increase it was easily worth it for me
