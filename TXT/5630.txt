Ordered 2 of these bags as I had used them before while deployed.  Both were purchased used and shipped to me overseas.  Both were shipped in heavy duty plastic vacuum sealed bags.  After unpacking they were as described, nearly new. No stains, rips, tears, smelled fresh and appeared to be brand new.  Extremely happy with the purchase and vendor service.  Would highly recommend to friends.
