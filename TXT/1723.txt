I can appreciate wanting to try to help others by sharing your expertise. However, proofreading is really mandatory if English is not your first language. I read the reviews before getting this but thought it couldn't be that bad. I'm sorry, but it's worse. Ms. Martin please make the effort to have this edited. You've got me curious now as to exactly what square hooks and Japan hooks are, not to mention what some of the other information refers to.  I am always hungry to know more, and if you fix this I guarantee I will update my review.
