This aquarium is sweet. I love the lights it makes your room glow. My only problem was the filter it came with is not very good. It doesn't keep the tank very clean. I would suggest getting something different if you want more than 5 fish. I found I was taking the water out and cleaning the entire tank every 2 weeks because of the build up algae and fish flakes the fish didn't eat. That's actually bad because your fish will be stressed from changing they're environment all the time. Most of the fish actually died Also do not put those claw frogs in there either, the tank won't be able to keep up with the mess they leave at all. I tried even putting a different pump in there but it just will not work because of the shape of the tank. I think if you want to buy this tank it has to be for looks only. To be able to maintain the aquarium and keep the fish healthy I suggest only having 3 very small fish.
