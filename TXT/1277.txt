For around $10 you can't go wrong with this case. The case has a nice feel to it. It does not feel cheap and is nice and grippy. The case has some soft stuff inside of it. This grips the phone really nicely and protects from scratches on the inside. The screen protector i was using at the time did not fit with this case so i did have to remove it. The reason i gave it 4/5 is because the cutout for the camera is a little large. Also the lock button is a little hard to access with this case. Other than that the cutouts for the buttons are perfect.
