This is the fourth KINDLE device I have purchased. Started with the original and have just kept updating. I have passed the older devices to family and yes they all still work. On the rare occasion that I've needed customer or technical support it's been handled very well by Amazon.Guess I qualify as a dedicated and loyal KINDLE user. Several friends have purchased KINDLES after using mine and finding out what they can do and how easy they are to use.
