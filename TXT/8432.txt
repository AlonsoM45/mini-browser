So... good vampires, bad vampires, soulmates, witches,... Haven't heard that before... I expected it to be bad, honestly. It didn't seem all that original with the vampire-loves-human-thing, but I am so glad that this book wasn't what I expected for once. Because this was a really good book. Wait... What am I saying? It's not good. Not at all. IT'S AWESOME!Yeah you saw that right. This is an awesome book. And you know what? It actually turned out to be pretty damn original. I love the vampires in this book and the whole soulmate-thing. Throw in a witch and your settled for a good time reading this book. The writing is also great. I mean, seriously. Ashley has a way with words and when I read this book she kept me guessing until the end. I loved the mysteries and unanswered questions that hooked me to the story. Good job Ashley!I love Amelia. She's awesome. Yeah, she had a hard life and she had a lot to deal with but she's also a stubborn, strong young woman and she doesn't like to be controlled. (Unlike some other characters in vampire-books... *cough*) She fights the bond even though it may hurt her and I like that about her. And in the end, she learns why her life was as s***ty as it was. So yeah, great main character: CHECK!Of course I loved Mitchel and Angelle and Eric and Luke and... All of them. The good guys were great and the bad guys were great. It's all great. Awesome awesome fantastic!I will read the next books in the series as soon as I've finished the other R2R-books, ARC's,... that are screaming at me from my TBR-mountain. (Yes mountain. Not a list, not a pile, a mountain.) "Shut up! I'll read you as soon as I can, okay? Yeesh..." Books these days...
