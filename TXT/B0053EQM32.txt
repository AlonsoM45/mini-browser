The holster is way too tight for my Glock 19. I can squeeze it into the holster, but when I try to pull it out, the whole holster comes with it. Not good at all. The holster is molded from one solid piece of plastic, and is sewn together. No way to stretch it out. If they put some elastic in place of the stitches, maybe I could use it.
