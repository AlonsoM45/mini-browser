The venue I rented only had rectangular tables, so I had to come up with something that worked and looked beautiful.  I used 2 of the 60X60 Square Table clothes for each table and underneath I had plain white full rectangular tablecloths I picked up cheap, so I placed the 2 tablecloths on each covered table and it was magnificent!! I got so many compliments on the decor.  I had 3 table cloths that had small stains after the reception and I put regular dish soap on the back side of the stain, used a delicate brush and rinsed out the stain, worked perfectly!!  I highly recommend these table cloths!!! They are absolutely gorgeous! Tried posting a picture, but amazon will only allow video and I do not have video.
