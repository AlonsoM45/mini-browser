My husband works on a boat and he needed a good case that would protect his phone from moisture and bait juice...ewe I know! Anyway, This case is so nice. It has the rubber part that goes completely around the phone then the plastic part that kind of seals the rubber and keeps it in place. So between the screen protector and the rubber/plastic case, no water......or bait juice is getting into that phone! Worth the $$.
