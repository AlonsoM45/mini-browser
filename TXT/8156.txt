Mass produced Chinese mount - a bit sketchy. Different as pictured and does not have the bolt - only thumb screw. Was banged up pretty good as well with corners missing paint. Rock solid for kids airsoft playtime, you can do way better for real AR builds. Little GGG mount is bomb proof and made in America! Return was challenged by Amazon...
