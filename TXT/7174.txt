Akira is a classic. If I can run at you screaming &#34;TETSUOOOOOO&#34; and you don't start screaming back &#34;KANEDAAAAA&#34; then I don't want to know you exist. The imagery and theming behind this movie influenced countless anime and scifi works to come. Chances are something will feel familiar and you'll realize that you've already seen references. If you haven't seen Akira already, get electricity and GET ON THAT. BREH!
