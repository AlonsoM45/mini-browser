The fabric is soft, which is great.  It looks like in the picture there are fold overs at the hands to cover baby from scratching herself, but its just a regular sleeve cuff.  For some reason the buttons are placed oddly... there are open flaps between buttons as baby goes about her day.  The cut is very boxy.  Not a lot of length but a LOT of extra room width-wise in the body, arms, legs...  Would probably be perfect for a chubbier baby
