These truffles are so tasty and smooth. When you first put it in your mouth they are a little bit bitter because of the cocoa powder, but as soon as its gone you taste the rich sweetness of the truffles. They came 2 days before the estimated delivery date! I would recomment these to everyone, especially chocolate lovers. They were totaly worth it for 2lbs of truffles!!
