I spent my early years (1940's) growing up in Louisiana and saw the division between blacks and whites - separate drinkingfountains - blacks only could sit at the back of the bus (my favorite spot) and thought it strange at the time.  Mr. Mandel'sbook brought it all back to me and I enjoyed his writing very much indeed - honest - truthful and sincere.  Thanks.
