We ordered this Ted doll for our son that is in college. It was the Christmas hit in our household. After much research trying to make sure we ordered the right doll, we certainly received the correct one. This doll is the &#34;EXPLICIT&#34; version. We learned we needed to order the one with the &#34;RED Letter R&#34; tag to get what we wanted (which we did)! He also sings the &#34;Thunder Song&#34;! To our surprise, he is huge...a true 24&#34;!! He also looked identical to the movie bear! We received this bear within 3 days, which was through our Amazon Prime account. I would highly recommend this one to anyone looking for these options. Will not be disappointed!
