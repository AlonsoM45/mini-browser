It really does everything that it is supposed to do but the hook will not close for me. I have had everyone I know try to get it to lock together but it is about 1/2&#34; out of place. Other than that inconvenience I have really loved the curlers.Oh yeah, they are not comfortable to sleep on so use a hooded dryer or make this a day project because it was one of the worst nights' sleep I have ever had.
