I am a new truck driver, I have my very 1st run an ill b gone for 6 weeks so I thought abt buying my husband this hat as a ill miss u gift an something he could use during his truck traning  So I did, I bought it an had a note put on it so he would know I bought this for him. I held my breath an waited for a phn call from him abt the package. The delievery date came up an still No call abt the package  I checked the tracking number an it said delievered. But it was to the WRONG address. So now I have no gift for my husband an I jus lost the money I paid for this hat. Its not retrieveable an now I'm miles away from home very upset I buy a lot off of amazon its my go 2 site over all I'm sure it was nice hat.
