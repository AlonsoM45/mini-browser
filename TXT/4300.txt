There are so many things to say about this game I'd probably go into it for another 30 minutes if I weren't short on time.  This game is a winner through and through.  The graphics and the music are both terrific, and the control scheme is exactly what it should be for a 3d Sonic game, unlike most of the new ones coming out on Gamecube, PS2 and all the newer systems.  This is the one that came out before all those, so it rightfully deserves credibility.  Even if this game wasn't very good, it would still be a must have just to showcase what Sega's dream was, but they perfectly portrayed that dream with the Sonic Adventure.  The story is a little weird at times as in not explaining things not to mention the ending was a bit corny, but who cares?  This game is a LOOOOOAAAAAD of fun.  If you want the ultimate Sonic experience, then you need to have this game.  It cost a little extra to get the original case, but it was definitely worth it.  Alright Sega!
