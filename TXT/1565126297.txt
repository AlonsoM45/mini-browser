Amazing on so many levels!  From the beginning, when you can't figure what the heck is going on, until the moment you realize that this is a historical, yet fictional representation of our culture.  Hard time putting it down, and find myself thinking about it at work.  Reflected in Jim Crow laws, the story line is placed in the future, but somehow familiar for me as a southern woman.
