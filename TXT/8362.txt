I heard a lot about this movie and was gonna be mad if it wasn't as good as the hype was so I did have high expectations and it exceeded them the story for this movie was intriguing and awesome it's refreshing to get something different from the copy and paste save the princess story he characters were funny and interest in you actually care for them there is a lot of singing but it is a Disney movie and that's nothing new compared to snow white or beauty and the beast or even tangled.
