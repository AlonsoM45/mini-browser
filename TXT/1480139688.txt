Patriot Dawn: It's fantastic for what it is.A novelization of Max's tactical manuals especially CONTACT and (I suspect since i have not read it yet) "Rapid Fire".I can tell some people where  a bit unenthused about the plot being a little thin. In my mind that's ok,. don't expect a Tom Clancyuesque yarn but something more valuable instead:A Tactical Manual written as a novel.  Everything he writes is in order to illustrate a tactical lesson he wants to teach.And he has  a lot to teach!I think this may be the best way to learn for many folks who simply can't get themselves to pick up a manual.Even though Max's manuals are not nearly as dry as most, I think this novelization approach may work quite well for many.Sometimes a plot element may seen a little contrived, just keep in mind what it's purpose is. If you want intricate plot twists, well developed characters and brilliant timeless dialogue, look elsewhere.If you want to learn while you read, this is the place.The book is best read using a pen and paper and drawing out the tactical situations as they occur in the book.A Map of Virginia to follow along is also helpful and aids in understanding.Be advised at the end of the book is a index of acronyms common in Combat arms.. check it out before you read.I hope everyone enjoys the book!PS: The plot thickens near the end  and there is a cliffhanger, can't wait until the next book ; )
