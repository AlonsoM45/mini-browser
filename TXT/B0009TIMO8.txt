I mean, it's power rangers. Did you like them growing up? I didn't but then again, I have nothing against them now, so I figured I'd throw it in the collection. With what results? You get to listen to the Power Ranger theme song over and over again until you have to turn the game off. Otherwise it's kind of cool, especially if you never watched the show growing up. It's a great way to get some insight about the show.
