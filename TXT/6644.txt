Being a fan of most of the regular tatoo shows i thought i'd give this a try......  Love it!! Not only do you get to see the artists doing their work but you also get a idea for the business aspect of running a sucessful shop.....  seeing the transformation from a so-so business to a top of the line studio makes for some intertaining viewing......  Cool show.......  Would recommend........
