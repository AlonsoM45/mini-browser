I am so happy I ordered these sofa legs. I bought brand new couch about six months ago. I looked on the internet and in various furniture show rooms looking for taller furniture. I'm 5'8" and most of the furniture was too low for me so I bought a sleeper sofa for the extra height and support. Most of my family and friends are tall so low sofas are a problem for most of us. These legs raised my couch up four more inches making it more comfortable and easier to sit down on and get up from. I have already recommended it to my family and friends before receiving them. I would recommend these legs for big tall disabled and older people. Also I received the legs a week ahead of schedule. I will be ordering these legs again for all of my sofas.
