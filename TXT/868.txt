Product came in a box, well wrapped up. 2 of the heads for body provided were a bit rusty.otherwise the machine works fine n the suction so far is pretty decent. Wish they supplied more cotton pads. I used it twice a wk, each time my face feels smooth after. Especially helpful for the oil seeds under eyes.
