It's not worth the aggregation!! I have a LG Cosmos. It fit's around your phone but you have to take it off to use your phone. It covers up all the function control buttons such as the volume, unlock, messaging, changing between characters/symbols, optional. It also interferes with sliding your phone opening to use the keyboard. I did contact Electromaster - stated it was meant for the LG Cosmo 2 phones. They were not very helpful and told me I needed to e-mail someone else. THERE IS A GOOD REASON "WHY IT WAS SUCH A LOW PRICE!!!"  I will be sure to contact AMAZON to help me deal with this issue. I will probably need to throw this away cause it might damage the phone. If the seller doesn't seem to take care of the problem. Do your research before you buy. If it really cheap, there is a reason behind why!!!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026PV6RI/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
