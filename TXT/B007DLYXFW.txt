I was a little disappointed in the quality of this tulle. I'm using it to make a 38 inch bustle on a tutu and it frayed on the ends and curled and got very weird looking. It does not match the straightness of the red tulle I have on the tutu so I'm going to have to go back, throw all the black tulle away, and buy a better quality tulle. Not happy at all, since I paid about $18 total for this material and I'm just having to throw it away and redo all my work. What a waste of my money.
