I have the medium and the large Rollypoly and use them on reqular bases, both have proven tough and convenient pouches. The roll up feature is very desirable,I believe its best feature, besides its very good construction.  I do not use the pouch very often in a traditional dump pouch function, attached to my belt or gear, but just as a compactable pouch to carry in my shooting bag to collect brass or carry gear while moving between stages in match environment.  The pouch has reinforced vents in the bottom and will stand upright by itself, if the wind is not to strong, with a few items in the bottom has no trouble with up right open use. Its sort of promoted as a dump pouch to be worn for magazine dumping, and can be used for this, though mounting variety is limited (thus only gave it 4 stars, gets 5 starts for durablilty and folding compact storage)..really, lest for me, it is just a tough, strong, well thoughtout folding, compact pouch that somehow is very useful for a variety of handy uses...in fact many many many times during events shooters ask me &#34;where did you get that pouch&#34; , &#34;who makes that&#34;  after I show them how it folds up..&#34; have to get one of those, now who makes it?&#34;
