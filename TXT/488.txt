This product is excellent.  The size is very compact and doesn't seem like it's larger than it needs to be.  I recently updated my TV from a LG 32in LCD to a LG 42in LED.  My PX21's were connected to the older TV via 3.5mm.  However, the newer TV was missing the 3.5mm port.  Connected an optical cable from my 360 slim to the FiiO, and the PX21's 3.5mm connector into the &#34;line out&#34; port on the FiiO.  On the 360, make sure the audio is set to &#34;Stereo&#34; because any of the &#34;Surround Sound&#34; setting will not output audio to the headphones. I believe if you connect the device to the TV, you change the audio settings on your TV to &#34;PCM&#34;.  I am very satisfied with this product.
