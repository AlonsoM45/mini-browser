I've had my eyes set on this necklace for months, just waiting for my birthday to buy it, and then a month afterwards. I finally placed the order and got it shipped on time, in perfect condition. Before ordering, I read some reviews and doubted they were accurate; I didn't believe the piece was so perfect. Now, every time it catches my eye, I spend 20 minutes just staring at it before I eventually put it on and then stare at it some more. The "drops of blood" and the red inside the heart are that perfect shade of crimson you wish you could find in a ruby. Also, I find the silver gleam of the necklace to truly stand out, it's so eye catching, and the necklace is a decent size too! Overall, I'm definitely pleased with this. In my opinion, it's a necklace like no other!
