One of those movies that make you feel so small in this world. If you like special effects, it's a film for you. This movie is packed with them and great fighting scenes of huge monsters and robots. I didn't give it 5 stars, because it's not one of those movies you could watch over and over again. As I mentioned it has a beautiful special effects, but the story line is not very strong. The idea is simple, somebody attacks the Earth and people start to fight for themselves. It's just a standard hero movie with great development and implementation of special effects.
