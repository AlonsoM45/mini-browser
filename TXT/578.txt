If you like quality do not  spend the cash. I have 5 Birkin inspired bags, Which I bought from a number of suppliers. This one is definitely not BIG, like it says in the picture. The seams appear very poorly made for the price.I compared the inside, outside, size. strength, & quality. And I find it to be the same exact bag i bought on Ebay for $29.00, both bags looks just like leather. The Ebay bag has side rounded double bound seams on the outside. Otherwise, both bags were exactly the same. Only difference is one smells like leather and the ebay one has silver hardware and amazon had gold. I will give it 3 stars only because its leather.  I love Amazon and will continue to buy, but this one is not worth it.
