Easy to set up; use it for dog to get on bed.  Bought it in advance of an upcoming surgery that places physical restrictions on me, including not picking up my 10-lb. dog.  He loves to sleep with me and didn't want to deny him getting on the bed just because I won't be able to lift him for a time.  Was able to quickly train him to use by placing treats on the stairs, moving the treat up 1 step at a time.  Now, just need to direct him verbally to use the stairs by saying, &#34;Stairs, Buddy&#34; and he climbs up them without the use of treats.  He still likes to just jump down from the bed, but that's okay.  At least he's learned to climb up them without my assistance.
