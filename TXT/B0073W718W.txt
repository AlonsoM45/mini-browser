We haven't had the phones too long but at this time there have been no problems. They are easy to read and easy to program. The clear reception is excellent. We live in an area that seems to be a landlocked &#34;Bermuda Triangle&#34; when it comes to telephone, cell phone and internet reception. So far these phones have performed very well.
