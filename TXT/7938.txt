I like the case but the screen protector wasnt the right one for the phone and the stylus doesnt work that great. Besides the fact that it kind of plugs into the headphone port of the phone and is in the way. I took it off and threw it in my junk drawer! The tuffy isnt so tuff granted these cases are very hard to get into anyway. One corner of the tuffy broke off into the slot of the case while trying to get it off. But other than that, I like these rubberized cases. Ive dropped my phone a handful of times and never had a broken screen or damaged my phone at all.
