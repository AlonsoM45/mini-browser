I saw this movie in theaters, and when I saw this film I didn't know anything about this movie other then that James Franco is in it.Now I think that James Franco is a great actor, but this movie without a doubt knocked him down a peg in my opinion. The movie starts with a horrible story and 5 characters that you can't help but hate. They all complain and they are just irritating and are the kind of people that make me give up on people today. This movie constantly repeats the same thing through the movie. For example they will say something and they will immediately replay it over and over another 2 or 3 times for God knows why, but I know it's incredibly irritating. This movie constantly repeats James Franco's incredibly stupid saying Spring Break, Spring break, Spring break Forever. And this is said more times then the number of times you wish the movie would end. There are not enough words to describe how much I hate this movie. I just don't get how some people enjoyed this. And I'm not bashing it because I have high movie standards. I have seen many bad but enjoyable movies, however Spring Breakers is not enjoyable in any way. It is so bad I am stunned I didn't walk out of this movie. But I gave it the benefit of the doubt and sat through this what felt like a forever long movie and thought something would happen that would redeem it. But nothing happened the ending is just as bad as the rest of this damn movie. And it ends with them repeating the same thing they do throughout the entire movie. I believe it is my destiny to warn people about this movie and save them the 94 minutes of there life that I will sadly never get back. Giving this movie one star is being to generous and it sickens me to give it that.
