Wall Street Journeyman is a remarkable book.  The novel takes us through the life and times of one man's journey to significant success on Wall Street trading desks and the subsequent decline in his career.  The vivid descriptions of his youth and the violence he and his family experienced at the hands of his father are graphic and chilling.  But his relationship with his father was very complicated and the specter of his old man haunts him throughout his life.  The protagonist is obviously brilliant and we hear his thoughts and feel his passion as he rises rapidly in the industry early in his career.  We see a man that is capable of great compassion and kindness, but also ruthless, aggressive behavior.  The protagonist is often quite reckless, but handles adversity with courage and conviction.  He is a man capable of twisted, decadent actions, but also someone that possesses a keen sense of humor and is brutally honest with himself throughout the saga.  The story is full of unexpected twists and turns with significant doses of dark humor.  The description and analysis of the financial industry is excellent.  The reader gets a first-hand look at the phenomenon that was Wall Street during the past twenty-five years.  We learn the kinds of money made by Wall Street professionals and the organization and business strategies of these firms.  We get a true inside look at the industry along with detailed descriptions of the crazy shenanigans and excesses these young, highly paid professionals got involved with.  Wall Street Journeyman is a triumph.  I strongly recommend taking the journey.
