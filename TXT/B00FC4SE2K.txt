I bought the case for a friend, as this was her first touch screen phone...and as she's like me in a few ways...she drops her phone quite often. It arrived either the day of the estimated delivery date...or the next day...either way it got there in less than a week, which is awesome, because I was told it would be a weeks time when I ordered a product and it didn't show for months. Over all we're very happy with the case :) We chose this one in particular because it came with a screen protector,,,now I just wish I could find one for me phone! :)
