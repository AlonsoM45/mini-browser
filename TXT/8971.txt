I've had this screen protector on for at least a week or two now, and I really have no complaints. My brother put it on for me, but he didn't have trouble with bubbles and the screen protector hasn't peeled or anything yet. It's working really well, and I'm very satisfied. Love that there are 3 screen protectors, they'll last a while.
